        summary: "<p>A classic song from English singer/songwriter/guitarist Richard Thompson, recounting the tragic tale of James and Red Molly. </p>", 
        content: "This is a song by English singer songwriter guitarist Richard Thompson It was first released on his album Rumor and Sigh in 1991 but has since because a staple of his live shows and I actually prefer some of the live renditions to the original studio version The song was never released as a single and so was never a hit for the general public but it s an easy song to appreciate and I ve never seen anyone give it a listen without at least liking it quite a bit And many including this author believe it to be a classic It helps to understand that the Vincent Black Lightning https en wikipedia org wiki Vincent Black Lightning was a real motorcycle and a very special machine It was produced in England from 1948 1952 and was designed to be as fast as possible It broke the motorcycle land speed record of the time going over 150 miles per hour Only 31 of these machines were ever built and one of the few surviving examples sold at auction in 2018 for just under a million dollars If you haven t already heard the song give it a listen now and familiarize yourself with the lyrics before our discussion starts > Says Red Molly to James That s a fine motorbike > A girl could feel special on any such like > Says James to Red Molly My hat s off to you > It s a Vincent Black Lightning 1952 > And I ve seen you at the corners and cafés it seems > Red hair and black leather my favorite color scheme > And he pulled her on behind > And down to Box Hill they did ride > > Said James to Red Molly Here s a ring for your right hand > But I ll tell you in earnest I m a dangerous man > For I ve fought with the law since I was seventeen > I ve robbed many a man to get my Vincent machine > And now I m 21 years I might make 22 > And I don t mind dying but for the love of you > And if fate should break my stride > Then I ll give you my Vincent to ride > > Come down come down Red Molly called Sergeant McRae > For they ve taken young James Adie for armed robbery > Shotgun blast to the chest left nothing inside > Come down Red Molly to his dying bedside > When she came to the hospital there wasn t much left > He was running out of road he was running out of breath > But he smiled to see her cry > He said I ll give you my Vincent to ride > > Says James In my opinion there s nothing in this world > Beats a 52 Vincent and a red headed girl > Now Nortons and Indians and Greeveses won t do > They don t have a soul like a Vincent 52 > He reached for her hand and he slipped her the keys > He said I ve got no further use for these > I see angels and ariels in leather and chrome > Swooping down from heaven to carry me home > And he gave her one last kiss and died > And he gave her his Vincent to ride A great compact little tale I m sure you ll agree But what makes this song so special First of course we can recognize it as a story song one that recounts a recognizable narrative arc with characters a series of events the passage of time and some definite conclusion In that it s similar to Long Black Veil https lexiconofsong org long black veil html as well as many other popular songs Unlike many other story songs though there s no real surprise no twist or wrinkle revealed near the end In fact this song is more akin to a classic tragedy as written by the Greeks or by Shakespeare we meet the characters we see their flaws and then watch as those flaws predictably bring them to ruin As Shakespeare said in Julius Caesar Men at some time are masters of their fates The fault dear Brutus is not in our stars but in ourselves But the song is also interestingly similar to a classic drama in another unusual way the story is presented almost exclusively by way of dialogue spoken by the dramatis personae In fact if you look back at the lyrics you ll see that each verse begins with a line of dialogue along with a statement of who is speaking and to whom they are speaking Now this is really unusual I can t think of another song that is presented in a similar way in such a play like fashion But I also think it s an element of the song that really works that continues to draw us in and keep us engaged as we hear one character after another step onto the stage and speak their lines And yet another interesting element of this short little ditty is the somewhat formal and almost stilted yet very concise use of language Consider phrases such as these + on any such like + my hat s off to you + a ring for your right hand + but for the love of you + if fate should break my stride So despite the fact that most of the action is being presented through dialogue these lines mostly avoid anything like the common vernacular of the day The overall effect I think is to immortalize these characters to separate them from the details of their time and place and lift them up into some more enduring firmament Which of course is where they rightly belong And then there s the machine itself Thompson sometimes introduces the song to his audience by saying It s a simple boy meets girl story complicated somewhat by the presence of a motorcycle But this particular motorcycle is of course more than merely incidental it is the solid center about which the entire story revolves Notice that in the final verse James dismisses any interest in other motorcycles saying They don t have a soul like a Vincent 52 Which reminds me of a quote from Steve Jobs https hbowie net quotes design is the fundamental soul of a man made creation html > Design is the fundamental soul of a man made creation that ends up expressing itself in successive outer layers of the product So when James talks about such a special machine having a soul he s certainly in good company But in this context I think the Vincent Black Lightning is an important symbol within the song Like the motorcycle both James Adie and Red Molly are presented as one offs as different from their peers as very special and intriguing individuals even if they are tragically flawed And what of James if not his soul is to be carried home in the final verse Such thoughts may also bring up memories of the singer Sandy Denny https en wikipedia org wiki Sandy Denny with whom Thompson made some very special music for a while but who died tragically at the age of 31 after tumbling down a flight of stairs in her home So more than anything else this is a song about integrity about being true to oneself and one s companions about having a distinctive inner essence that expresses itself through successive outer layers of form and function of word and deed And then there s one more element of the song that I find remarkable which is the degree of agency granted to Red Molly She is not just the girl adorning the back of the bike After all she is the one who takes the initiative that starts this whole ball rolling expressing her admiration of his machine to James And she is the one given the keys to the machine when James dies and given the bike not just to possess but to ride So much for the lyrics But the music and quiet guitar accompaniment are equally notable Notice how the first line of each verse proceeds in an almost halting fashion spoken as much as sung the words coming out at a measured pace Then the next three lines come out a bit faster with the exposition starting to pick up the pace a bit Then lines five and six come tumbling out at full speed generally presenting the key dramatic turning point of the verse And then lines seven and eight explode out but only in the final verse where they provide an extra dramatic flourish for James dying scene Then the pace suddenly slows for the next to last line ending with a dramatic pause Then the final line of the verse comes round in a lower register and then drops even lower for that last word a deeply resonant drawn out r i d e And behind the expressive vocals there s Thompson accompanying himself on acoustic guitar with a quiet spritely finger picking always busy in the background but only taking center stage between the vocals And while others have covered the song often with a full band nothing else seems to quite fit the the peculiar pulse of this song as well as Thompson s own deft handiwork And so there we have it a deceptively simple yet completely remarkable song and about as perfect a gem as one might request No wonder TIME magazine added it to their list of All TIME 100 Songs https entertainment time com 2011 10 24 the all time 100 songs slide 1952 vincent black lightning richard thompson saying that Thompson s song wins the prize for fusing his sound and storytelling into a glorious example of what one guy can accomplish with just a guitar a voice an imagination and a set of astonishingly nimble fingers"

        content: "I d been aware of Paul Thorn thorn for some time but didn t really become a fan until I saw him live last summer at The Ark ark in Ann Arbor I convinced an old University of Michigan roommate to come with me while I was in town as an opportunity to catch up but we were both caught off guard by how much we loved Thorn s show I ve been listening to Thorn s recordings regularly since then and can now bear witness to a great catalog cd that stands up to deep and repeated listening Musically Thorn reminds me of Delbert McClinton dc and a few other artists who have somewhat belatedly been collected under the Americana banner He has a great group of regular bandmates playing drums bass guitars and keyboards and they are more than capable of drawing on most American music traditions blues folk rhythm n blues soul country rock n roll gospel and so on to conjure up a strong effective varied and emotive backing for whatever song Thorn has chosen to deliver Thorn s voice seems a force of particularly American nature It s not pretty or showy and wouldn t ever be caught dead on one of the insipid television talent shows that are endlessly advertised these days but it is wonderfully expressive and deeply layered like a powerful piece of wood that has been torn from the depths of some aged tree with complex and unique grains that bely its troubled but ultimately enduring heritage No matter what he s singing at the moment listen closely and you can hear ancient American voices echoing down over the generations distilled into something as complex and satisfying as a fine aged whiskey As a musical ensemble Thorn and company are as reminiscent of The Band band as anyone else making a similar musical stew out of their mongrel American musical heritage and mixing rhythm instruments keyboards guitars and rough vocals with little respect for established genres but with endless respect for their material Which brings us to the subject of Thorn s songs Almost all of his material is original and he seems to write about and for a mostly white older rural rust belt sort of audience And most of his songs are remarkably simple on the surface And yet listen closely to his best compositions and he always seems to be speaking to us on multiple levels In this he reminds me of no one less than Ray Davies and The Kinks kinks For just as Davies refused to pander to American audiences and remained steadfastly British and sang about forgotten or vanishing English characters and traditions Thorn seems on just as contrarian a mission to sing about American scenes and characters that many of us might just as soon fly over or forget And he does this with just as much self awareness as Davies had letting us know in subtle ways such as the name of his label Perpetual Obscurity Records that he s fully aware that there is a broader younger hipper more lucrative audience out there It s not that he doesn t know about it he s just not interested in it This song from his first album Hammer and Nail is as good an introduction as any to Thorn s world I encourage you to listen along using whatever device and sources you have available and let s pay attention to the words > I saw a garage sale > Pulled up in the yard > Found a statue of Jesus > That was eight feet tall > He held out his arms > And he seemed all alone > So I loaded him up > And I drove him home Simple right But look at what Thorn s done here He s placed us in a particular slice of our American landscape If you are only used to life in one of our big cities then you probably feel like you ve been dropped onto an alien planet one populated with pickup trucks garage sales full of castoff junk and outsized religious statuary There s also an element of comedy here right A giant statue of Jesus being bought and sold at a garage sale It s hard to conjure up the scene without evoking an amused smile But at the same time there s also a sense of pathos Our main character is without a companion stopping at garage sales projecting his own feelings of isolation onto an inanimate religious figure I mean it sounds kind of sad doesn t it At the same time though this reference to the statue of Jesus holding out his arms and seeming all alone begins to lend this figure its own independent identity as if it was not just an image of something else but was actually something or someone on its own There you go Four paragraphs of mine to unpack Thorn s first eight lines Let s see what happens next > Out by my driveway he > Looks down the street > With long hair and sandals made > Of rebar and concrete > I painted him white > With a long purple robe > He s a rock of ages > On our gravel road Again there s a comic element This is not a conventional pious stained glass image of Christ but a figure with long hair and sandals not to mention a purple robe And he s made of rebar and concrete not marble We re not on a Rick Steves steves tour of European art treasures here but a Paul Thorn tour of American life outside the city limits arguably just as illuminating especially if we re more interested in the 21st century than the 16th And then of course there s the priceless last line He s a rock of ages on our gravel road mixing the high and the low the metaphorical idea of a rock of ages and the literal hunk of concrete now resting next to this guy s driveway the timeless nature of an unbreakable rock alongside the scattered gravel making up the road on which our main character resides And now we come to the first delivery of the song s chorus > He s an eight hundred pound Jesus > Standing taller than a tree > He s an eight hundred pound Jesus > A bigger man than you or me Again we find the comic mixed with the epic and again we find more playful ambiguity a bigger man than you or me I mean of course this 800 pound eight foot figure is literally larger than either the singer or the listener but we re also referring to the stature of his character aren t we But then is it the character of the person god the statue is meant to represent or is it the character of the statue itself Let s see how the next chapter unfolds > I thought losin my job was > The end of the world > Til my best pal > Ran off with my best girl > I felt suicidal > With no real friends > So I walked outside > With a rope in my hand Wait a minute is this still a joke It s getting awfully real isn t it There are no comforting double messages now Carrying a rope outside while feeling suicidal That s pretty explicit and there s only one thing it might mean > Out by that statue > There s a big oak tree > So I stood on his shoulders > And I counted to three > I had every intention > Of buyin the farm > But when I jumped off > He caught me in his arms How are we to interpret this It s hard to believe a guy trying to hang himself could accidentally fall into the arms of a concrete statue Is this a modern miracle At this point we should note that for a song referencing the central figure of Christianity it is decidedly odd that our singer has not once referred to the religious historical figure of Christ himself but has instead focused only on a particular statue of this personage Unlike so many others he is not claiming to have been spiritually saved by Christ but physically saved by the 800 pound statue of Christ sitting in his yard And so at this point in the song it feels like we have entered the realm of magical realism magic akin to a Guillermo del Toro deltoro film such as Pan s Labyrinth and The Shape of Water We re now treated to another round of the chorus and then to the concluding verse > I wanted to return > The favor to him > Cause I never had > A more solid friend > So I planted some flowers > All around his feet > And I bought him a flock > Of ceramic sheep So now after this brush with death saved only by the magical actions of a chunk of rebar and concrete we are returned to the comforting familiar bucolic scene of random religious statuary scattered across our rural countryside observed once again through the singer s wry lens playing with the double meaning of a solid friend So what are we to make of this song as a whole What is it about Before attempting to answer this question it might help to know that this towering concrete Jesus really exists FB and is happily owned by Paul having been passed down to him from his father Thorn says about it Every time I look at it makes me smile And this is what makes Thorn s musical world so damned compelling Because he starts with real people and events and then makes up these little musical stories about them allowing us to look down on his characters from an ironic distance while at the same town identifying with them so strongly that we can t help leaving with an enhanced sense of our shared humanity So what is this song about Let me try to give you some approximation of the thoughts and feelings I come away with Being human is hard People do suffer reversals of fortune Humans do sometimes feel lonely and isolated They do sometimes feel tempted to take their own lives And a belief in something larger than themselves is often what makes the difference And such beliefs do often seem silly when looked at from an outsider s perspective But hey we re all on the inside as well as the outside all in need of a solid friend at times all in need of something to believe in all in need of stories to tell ourselves all leading lives not worth living if they re bereft of some form of enchantment That s an awful lot of meaning to pack into a track clocking in at just under three minutes If you re not yet familiar with Paul Thorn and his work then I urge you to see him in person tour and listen in depth to his catalog itunes Just don t make the mistake of taking him at face value Despite his obscurity he s an artist who punches well above his weight americana https en wikipedia org wiki Americana music ark https theark org band https www

this website is taken from some words spoken by Bob Dylan during a 1997 interview https www newsweek com dylan revisited 174056 for Newsweek magazine > Here s the thing with me and the religious thing This is the flat out truth I find the religiosity and philosophy in the music I don t find it anywhere else Songs like Let Me Rest on a Peaceful Mountain or I Saw the Light that s my religion I don t adhere to rabbis preachers evangelists all of that I ve learned more from the songs than I ve learned from any of this kind of entity The songs are my lexicon I believe the songs Now it so happens that I agree with Dylan on all of the points he makes above The songs I love the songs I ve listened to repeatedly over the years the songs that resonate with me these are the cornerstones of my personal belief system my own construction of meaning for myself A bit earlier than Dylan author C S Lewis http en wikipedia org wiki C S Lewis observed > Those of us who have been true readers all our life seldom fully realize the enormous extension of our being which we owe to authors We realize it best when we talk with an unliterary friend He may be full of goodness and good sense but he inhabits a tiny world In it we should be suffocated The man who is contented to be only himself and therefore less a self is in prison Lewis was talking about his sense of obligation to books and their creators but I have long felt a similar debt owed to those who write songs and those who perform them Oh yes I ve learned a lot from books but many of the songs that I ve heard have taught me something new about the world about other people about what it means to be human in the space of two to five minutes Without them as Lewis said I would truly inhabit a tiny world that would feel like a prison to me Song listeners today are living in a golden age We ve had great songwriters singers performers and recording artists hard at work for a long time and almost all of this treasure is now available to us via CDs downloads and streaming services At the same time though we are living through a time in which songs are mostly used as aural wallpaper Wherever we go there they are playing in the background And of course most of them don t deserve any more attention than we give them As Raymond Chandler http en wikipedia org wiki Raymond Chandler once observed about popular art forms > There are no vital and significant forms of art there is only art and precious little of that And so I fear many of us have learned to expect little from the songs we listen to I would like to raise those expectations My approach on Lexicon of Song https lexiconofsong org will be to write about one song at a time exploring the depth of meaning each of these has for me and sharing some of my observations and insights about the nature of the songwriter s art in each piece My goals with this writing will be to encourage readers to Pay more attention to the lyrics of the songs they re listening to Become more conscious of what the songwriter may be expressing in their work Use this enhanced awareness to expand their own lives In no case will I be trying to suggest that my writing can fully convey the meaning of a song that I m writing about nor will I ever be trying to impose my interpretation of a song as some sort of absolute canon I will be happy if each reader listens and thinks for themselves but perhaps engages in both of these activities more deeply than they may have done before Author I m Herb Bowie and I am the author editor and curator for this site If you re

        content: "Let s start by looking at the lyrics This song came off of Bob Dylan s John Wesley Harding album which marked a radical departure from his previous recordings His older compositions often had many more than the standard three verses of popular songs Positively Fourth Street boasted twelve His lyrics had often been pointed and sharply critical His use of language was unusual and called attention to itself by juxtaposing words and images not usually associated with each other In contrast All Along The Watchtower is spare and restrained The song consists of only three verses with no chorus The language is simple Yet the three verses are packed with meaning and drama Let s see how it starts > There must be some kind of way out of here > Said the joker to the thief Notice how Dylan starts the song by throwing us into the middle of a conversation and begins with an urgent statement We don t know where the here is from which the speaker wants to escape but we know he wants out The sense of drama is immediate We find out that the two people speaking are the joker and the thief These are archetypal characters that have existed in one form or another for thousands of years By identifying them in this way Dylan invokes a sense of timelessness Because these figures are broad archetypes there is already a suggestion that this might be a parable of some sort a story whose essence remains the same over many different times places and characters The joker or jester can be seen in general to represent the artist someone whose role is to amuse other members of the established order but also to provoke them to suggest alternate ways of looking at reality And of course the joker and the thief are both outsiders of a sort united in their separation from more ordered segments of society > There s too much confusion > I can t get no relief > Businessmen they drink my wine > Plowmen dig my earth > None of them along the line > Know what any of it is worth The rest of the verse tells us why the joker wants to escape there is too much confusion But what is confused Others are benefiting from his labors and working for him to help produce the results But neither understands the worth of their efforts So the confusion is about values what is valuable and what is not > No reason to get excited > The thief he kindly spoke > There are many here among us > Who feel that life is but a joke > But you and I we ve been through that > And this is not our fate > So let us not talk falsely now > The hour is getting late The second verse begins with the thief speaking kindly to the joker This adverb lets us know that he is sympathetic and that he perhaps understands the worth of the joker and his efforts The thief goes on to say that while there are those who think that life is but a joke the thief and the joker know better having lived through that So while others may still be confused these two are not Since they understand the value of life it is important for them to be truthful with one another Then the last line of the verse brings us back from exposition to a sense of drama and movement and impending action the hour is getting late > All along the watchtower > Princes kept the view > While all the women came and went > Barefoot servants too > Outside in the cold distance > A wildcat did growl > Two riders were approaching and > The wind began to howl The beginning of this final verse suddenly shifts the scene without at first giving us any sense of how this new setting connects to the first one In contrast to the first two verses which were full of conversation this verse unfolds almost cinematically full of visual imagery This new scene is populated with princes women and barefoot servants establishing a time and place in the past although again using enduring archetypal figures These figures guarding their castle seem to represent established society and the existing power structure But what are they guarding against A wildcat growls from a distance suggesting the savage untamed power of nature lurking just beyond the well ordered lights of the castle Then we see the two riders approaching Suddenly in only four words the first two verses are connected with the last With a sort of cinematic establishing shot but used at the end of the story rather than the beginning we see the thief and the joker approaching the castle We already know that they want to establish a different set of values one based on the worth of human life Their approach towards the guarded castle suggests an impending confrontation And then the last line of the song strengthens this suggestion with imagery of a furious storm starting to build Note how this last verse has made physical the relationships suggested in the previous lines The thief joker and wildcat are all placed outside the castle which is occupied by princes and servants So we now have in a very concrete sense independent outsiders and a rigid power hierarchy Dylan s accomplishment here is nothing less than amazing In the space of a few verses in a song so spare it could almost be missed as a throw away Dylan manages to accomplish all of the following Summarizes his own life to date Given his earlier efforts to make pointed fun of almost everything around him and his near fatal motorcycle crash that marked a turning point in his career it is hard not to see the joker as Dylan himself He has now learned that life is not a joke and distinguishes between artists and outsiders who understand the seriousness of life versus the businessmen and fans who treat his art as simply a marketable commodity Identifies the primary issue of our time as one of values Modern thinkers such as Ken Wilber https en wikipedia org wiki Ken Wilber with his image of our contemporary flatland in which everything is seen as neutral and devoid of value are brought to mind In earlier songs Dylan talked tirelessly of modern figures misunderstanding the significance of issues such as war freedom and poverty Here Dylan stands back from these specific issues and reduces the confrontation to its essential element human values against the established order Propels his theme with a powerful dramatic structure From a traditional dramatic viewpoint almost nothing happens in this song two riders talk to each other while approaching a castle We ve hardly got a decent first act let alone a whole play Yet by repeatedly hinting at the intensity of a coming confrontation and by identifying the two opposing forces Dylan keeps us on the edges of our seats wondering what will happen next The effect at the end is comparable to the conclusion of William Butler Yeats famous poem The Second Coming https www poetryfoundation org poems 43290 the second coming And what rough beast its hour come round at last slouches towards Bethlehem to be born In both cases there is a perceptible chill creeping up the spine as the poet leaves his reader to contemplate the inevitability and intensity of the coming confrontation and its consequences Dylan s original reading of the song is as spare and compact as his words with the music adding little But many other artists have covered this song over the years starting with what is probably the best known version by Jimi Hendrix And the Hendrix version is nothing short of brilliant with arrangement instrumentation and vocals all helping to flesh out the bare bones of the words So I believe it s worth taking a little time to see what Hendrix does with it The first element to note is how the music here parallels the dramatic structure of the song Listen to the opening drums and guitars as one example The beat starts intensifies and then stops As in the lyrics the power is hinted at but not unleashed The music like the words points towards some future action presents the tension but does not resolve it This device is repeated throughout the song with Hendrix mostly holding back repeatedly returning the song to its basically quiet pace The second element I want to note is Hendrix use of guitar to represent the confusion that the joker is experiencing This is a perfect role for Jimi of course since his guitar parts often defied our normal expectations for the instrument He uses bent notes a wah wah pedal and other devices to represent a disorienting almost inhuman sonic landscape The third musical element I want to comment on and the one that really frames and defines the whole song is Jimi s repeated gradually progressing ascents up the scale with blistering notes Listen first to the guitar break between the first and second verses Then listen to the second and longer guitar break between the second and third verses And then finally listen to the way it sounds at the end of the song Notice how Jimi seems to be gradually reaching for a note that he only finally hits at the end of the song And then when he gets there he repeats it over and over making a high keening sound representing not only the howling wind referred to in the last line but that coming conflict that the song so clearly prepares us for And the music ends on this note as do the lyrics without resolution but clearly pointing forwards to some anticipated future act of liberation This is simply a brilliant collaboration between songwriter and musician the accompaniment extending and reinforcing the meaning and drama of the lyrics and showcasing the unique possibilities of the electric guitar along with nothing more than a bass drum kit and acoustic guitar"

imperfect copies were made Unlike some singer songwriters of the sixties Nyro s voice singing playing and arrangements were more than the equal of those who popularized her songs and there s really no reason to seek them out until you ve fully absorbed Nyro s own version The music starts off in a dirge like vein appropriate for a funeral but then quickly shifts into an uptempo treatment full of liveliness and vitality with Nyro s voice alternately swooping and confiding shivering and shouting husky and full throated making it clear that despite her topic rigor mortis is nowhere near It s easy to underestimate Nyro s achievement here especially in light of all the unavoidable cover versions of the song that tend to somewhat muddy the song s impact One can easily view this as sort of a youthful exploration of Nyro s many emerging talents but lacking any special coherence For me though this is an amazingly mature and prescient song for Nyro to have recorded in 1967 Think of it as a modern humanistic companion to John Donne s famous sonnet Death be not proud https www poets org poetsorg poem death be not proud holy sonnet 10 whereas Donne was reflecting on a supposed eternal life Nyro makes the following points Death is a natural physical event not a metaphysical one Death deserves and will receive from her no special reverence She has no interest in debating the existence of an afterlife She s happy to let others adopt whatever attitudes towards death they may prefer All she asks is freedom to live and die by her own lights If there is some sort of continuance of her own life after death then it will take the form not of some otherworldly existence but of one child born and a world to carry on And then to have wrapped all of these striking insights into a dizzying horn soaked uplifting musical performance that leaves listeners happily humming along and tapping their feet and that gets off the stage in roughly two and a half minutes it s a remarkably mature and sophisticated achievement for an artist of any age We might be tempted to think that these apparently humanistic themes in her song were merely accidental or incidental to her motivations to write a hit song but then Wikipedia informs us pedia that Nyro credited the Sunday school at the New York Society for Ethical Culture enyc with providing the basis of her education This institution was and still is associated with a branch of humanism that maintains the importance of congregational structures and so adopted many of the practices of traditional religions but without a belief in any sort of god It may be helpful as well to note that Nyro s later life and death did indeed mirror her words in this song You can read more on Wikipedia https en wikipedia org wiki Laura Nyro apple https

        summary: "<p>This song was released on John Prine&#8217;s first, self-titled, album, when the singer-songwriter was just twenty-five years of age. </p>", 
        content: "This song was released on John Prine s first self titled album when the singer songwriter was just twenty five years of age Prine grew up near Chicago and studied at that city s Old Town School of Folk Music https www oldtownschool org a fine establishment I ve visited several times and one that is still delivering concerts and classes today Prine was working as a mailman before turning to music as a full time career He remembers delivering newspapers to a Baptist old peoples home where he had to go room to room and there developed something of an affinity for our aging population These memories and observations led him to write a song called Hello In There for that first album A friend liked that song so much that he suggested Prine write another song about old people And that suggestion led Prine to pen Angel from Montgomery pulling the song s words and images from some deeper reservoir Prine s album was released in 1971 and Angel from Montgomery immediately began life as a song for other artists to cover But it was Bonnie Raitt s rendition on her 1974 album Streetlights when Raitt was just twenty six that first fully brought the song to life And although other artists have sung the song since then Raitt s countless live versions over the years have made it something of a signature song for her and few would dispute the assertion that she has thoroughly made it her own That being said though she also performed on stage with Prine many times over the years and is always quick to give him credit for the composition With that introduction behind us let s give this thing a listen As we do so consider the the simplicity and understatement of the lyrics and music The words and delivery are easy and conversational slow and measured The words are everyday terms that we can easily imagine being used by pretty much anyone Prine and Raitt aren t looking at this woman s life from the outside they re letting us feel it from the inside After each chunk of the song I ll comment on what we ve just read heard > I am an old woman > Named after my mother > My old man is another > Child that s grown old A simple straightforward introduction with only the last line with its unusual wording of a child that s grown old giving us a hint of what s to come Note that other than the occasional rhyming of lines 2 and 3 as in this first verse the words are fairly free of any of the usual poetic devices adding to the natural unaffected conversational feel of the song > If dreams were thunder > And lightning were desire > This old house would have burnt down > A long time ago It is here that Prine first makes a transition from naturalism to a species of magical realism a sort of poetic expression that does not call attention to itself as such still using everyday words but now using imagery to comment on this woman s life in an indirect way Note interestingly that she first says If dreams were thunder but then says if lightning were desire reversing the sequence in which a physical manifestation is compared to an inner state as if the two realms were interchangeable Consider the feat that Prine manages to pull off here for he has contrived to have this woman let us know in her own words of her own passionate long simmering dreams and desires without ever referring to them directly and so making it clear that these feelings are long buried and rarely if ever directly expressed And that takes us to the nub of the portrait that Prine is painting for us > Make me an angel > That flies from Montgomery > Make me a poster > Of an old rodeo > Just give me one thing > That I can hold on to > To believe in this living > Is just a hard way to go Note how the music surges and swells on the chorus lifting us out of the humdrum details of the singer s daily existence and taking us up into a more exalted plane of her inner world When she uses the phrase make me it is unclear whether she means it in the sense of make me a pot of coffee or make me a better person But again this ambiguity does not need to be resolved because we are no longer talking in any literal sense anyway but instead are invoking spirits from some sort of Jungian collective unconscious Prine has said he used the city of Montgomery in the song because it was closely associated with the life of country singer Hank Williams And so the figure of an angel the city haunted by Hank Williams and a poster of an old rodeo are all powerful images symbolizing a world of freedom and adventure and liberation from earthly cares And then of course the last four lines of the chorus above contrast these powerful images with the current state of her life > When I was a young girl > Well I had me a cowboy > He weren t much to look at > Just a free rambling man Now the singer begins to elaborate on the reasons why these images she has conjured up are so meaningful for her > But that was a long time > And no matter how I try > Those years just flow by > Like a broken down dam Again though she s brought back to her current reality although again concluding the verse with another poetic image rather than a literal expression of facts > Chorus > > There s flies in the kitchen > I can hear them they re buzzing > And I ain t done nothing > Since I woke up today > > How the hell can a person > Go to work in the morning > And come home in the evening > And have nothing to say In these last verses we finally get a complete picture of the singer s daily life and can fully understand her situation It is not just that she s old not just that her best years are behind her not just that she s haunted by memories of her younger self rather it is that her current life has lost all meaning Neither her surroundings nor her activities nor her partner have any interest or significance for her No wonder then that she appeals again in the chorus for some sort of deliverance no wonder that she once again invokes these powerful images that still have resonance for her no wonder that she asks again for one thing I can hold on to This is such a high example of the craft of singer and songwriter and musicians Prine s composition is so simple and yet paints such a searing portrait of the character he s describing If the goal of art is to transmute the seeming dross of our lives often apparently random and mundane into something imbued with meaning and significance then Prine has certainly met that standard here And the arrangement of the song for Raitt s version crafted with help from Freebo and with Freebo s graceful bass lines seems wonderfully effective and understated The music builds gradually but always behind the vocals leaving the focus on the woman singing And then there s Bonnie s vocal delivery This young singer who spent her early years in California and New England delivers the words with a lazy drawl that makes me think of an old woman rocking on a weathered dusty porch before the meaning of Prine s words even have a chance to enter my consciousness And the full power of Raitt s voice is carefully contained only hinted at briefly when it s time to give us a feeling for the fire and spirit of our character as a young girl to let us glimpse the still burning embers that continue to smolder somewhere deep inside of this old woman s breast There are certainly other renditions of this song out there But at least to my ear these often sound like an old woman s story being sung and performed with the energy and passion of youth I think Bonnie and Freebo got it exactly right because this is a song of remembered passions and a quiet plea for deliverance not an expression of high emotions being currently felt On a personal note my mother in law is now ninety four and in a residence much like the one Prine used to visit as a postman She s not familiar with this song but I can t help listening to it play between my ears whenever I pay her a visit Not sure it gets much better than this when it comes to the composition and delivery of a song"

        content: "The music for this song was composed by Grateful Dead bassist Phil Lesh with lyrics by Robert Hunter Hunter wrote the words in response to a request from Lesh to help write a song he could sing to his dying father The song first appeared on the album American Beauty released in 1970 There are several unusual aspects to the band s performance on this track Lesh plays acoustic guitar Dave Torbert plays bass David Nelson plays lead guitar on a Fender Telecaster while Jerry Garcia plays the piano It s a rich track musically with intertwining voices and instruments so it s best to hear it in as uncompressed and high fidelity a fashion as possible The first thing to note about this song is that although Hunter could have responded to Lesh s request with some very specific words about a child sitting with a dying parent he instead generalized and broadened the song s scope to instead speak to all of us about the meaning of life and death And while I think it s clear that these are the topics Hunter is talking about here the second thing to note is how obliquely he approaches them He certainly doesn t want to prescribe any answers but instead wants to speak to us using the language of poetry and metaphor He perhaps wants to give some shape and color to the smoke but has no interest in dispelling any mystery on the contrary he seemingly wants us to feel the genuine mystery contained in these topics all the more deeply It s worthwhile comparing this song to Jackson Browne s For A Dancer since both deal with very similar topics and both suggest a similar sense of mystery yet the two songs take very different approaches lyrically Let s see what Hunter does I ll add some commentary after each verse > Look out of any window > Any morning any evening any day > Maybe the sun is shining > Birds are winging or > Rain is falling from a heavy sky > What do you want me to do > To do for you to see you through > For this is all a dream we dreamed > One afternoon long ago In the first two lines Hunter starts by directing our attention to something outside and yet clearly indicates by repeated use of the word any that the thing he wants us to observe is universal and not specific to some special perspective location or situation In the next three lines Hunter continues his suggestion that what he wants us to observe is some universal condition that is present no matter what the physical conditions are around us Again though we are asked to look outside and observe physical phenomena in the world around us Hunter then asks what we want from him And judging by his next observation that this is all a dream he seems to be suggesting that he is powerless to help whether we want something related to the sun and the rain and the birds or related to larger questions of life and death It s worth paying attention to Hunter s rhyming patterns here Most songwriters use a strong rhyme at the ends of their lines but here Hunter seems to shy away from anything that authoritative Instead we have lots of interior rhymes within the lines morning evening shining winging falling do you through dream dreamed contributing to the meandering dreamlike feel of the lyrics > Walk out of any doorway > Feel your way feel your way > Like the day before > Maybe you ll find direction > Around some corner > Where it s been waiting to meet you > What do you want me to do > To watch for you while you re sleeping > Then please don t be surprised > When you find me dreaming too Hunter again provides us with instructions but this time not just to observe but to act He asks us to proceed out of any doorway not with some particular destination in mind but simply to engage with the world around us and to find meaning from that engagement He s not telling us the purpose of life but he s telling us how to find that purpose and it s not through inner vision but through outer action Once again he asks us what we want from him and then before we can answer tells us again that he has no more power than we do no more answers than we have > Look into any eyes > You find by you you can see > Clear through to another day > Maybe been seen before > Through other eyes on other days > While going home > What do you want me to do > To do for you to see you through > It s all a dream we dreamed > One afternoon long ago Now having asked us to look outside then to walk outside Hunter asks us to look into the eyes of another human Not some particular person not some special love but just the ordinary eyes of whatever person we come upon and then suggests that by doing so we can see our way through today s challenges to tomorrow Again he s suggesting that what he s asking us to observe is not something special but probably something that s been seen before through other eyes on our way to whatever we may deem to be home Hunter is not calling our attention to some special occurrence but to things so ordinary that we run the danger of taking them for granted > Walk into splintered sunlight > Inch your way through dead dreams > To another land > Maybe you re tired and broken > Your tongue is twisted > With words half spoken > And thoughts unclear > What do you want me to do > To do for you to see you through > A box of rain will ease the pain > And love will see you through Having set us on a mission Hunter now urges us to continue onward no matter what challenges we might face no matter what condition we may find ourselves in And what is this promised land we are seeking what is the answer to our questions the help we ve been seeking Just this box of rain we might call the world and the love we can forge between ourselves and other humans > Just a box of rain > Wind and water > Believe it if you need it > If you don t just pass it on > Sun and shower > Wind and rain > In and out the window > Like a moth before a flame And now having finally answered our questions provided the help we ve been seeking Hunter reiterates and emphasizes the answer just to be sure we haven t missed it But rather than insisting that we believe him he casually suggests we take his advice for what we think it s worth and just pass it on if we don t want it He further emphasizes his equanimity suggesting that no matter what the weather it s all the same to him But then with the last two lines he adds a sense of urgency raising directly for the first time the question of life and death with the image of a moth before a flame > And it s just a box of rain > I don t know who put it there > Believe it if you need it > Or leave it if you dare > And it s just a box of rain > Or a ribbon for your hair > Such a long long time to be gone > And a short time to be there And now in the final verse Hunter speaks to us as directly and clearly and urgently as he ever will Yes he says this world we live in is nothing but a box of rain and he has no knowledge of any divine reason for its existence or ours You can believe that your life here is meaningful or not but this may well be all we have so don t throw it away lightly And then with one master stroke with just one line a mere five words Hunter swoops down from the general to the achingly particular offering a ribbon for your hair investing all the potential meaning of our earthly existence in this one simple physical gesture conjuring up the beauty and the innocence of a young girl and daring us to throw this away to deny its meaning And finally in the last two lines Hunter summarizes his case reminding us that the time given to us on this world is so short and that once we die we are simply gone The song structure beautifully supports the thrust of the words We have four verses with repeated lyrical and musical structures but no chorus And then we have two final verses with very different musical and lyrical structures The lines and rhymes of the first four verses are meandering questioning The last two are short and direct And while line ending rhymes eluded us earlier the last verse drives its meaning home with the confident and conclusive line endings of there dare hair there This is a great song but the original studio recording is also a great performance The instruments and voices weave in and out combining in intricate harmonies one moment then receding to leave a singular voice the next Although Lesh rarely sang lead vocals here his rough untutored voice proves a perfect match for the words with just the right combination of humanity warmth and knowing distance while Garcia and others combine with warm harmonies on key phrases physically conveying the human connection that the song offers up as key to understanding the meaning of our time here on earth It s hard to think of another song or songwriter or band that would even attempt to deliver such a delicate resonant impression as this one let alone one that could do it so masterfully Even if the group had never played a single live show this recording would be one for the ages"

        content: "The lyrics in this song work so well because of their simple understatement As in the title the single word Christmas is repeated by the background choir to begin each line of the song Darlene Love then describes in the briefest of sketches familiar elements of Christmas The snow s coming down Lots of people around Pretty lights on the trees etc Each verse ends with the same line Christmas Baby Please Come Home The chorus fills in the sketchiest of details > They re singing Deck the Halls > But it s not like Christmas at all > Cause I remember when you were here > And all the fun we had last year And that s all we re told really Boy and girl together last Christmas Boy and girl not together this Christmas Girl misses boy So the apparent conflict is in their separation But there s something else going on here There is no happy ending The boy never shows up If we listen closely to the lyrics and their delivery though we can feel another kind of tension There is another conflict occurring and that is between the forced joy of the season and the singer s own personal feelings of being sad and lonely Once we become aware of this implicit conflict the pieces of the song fall into place We realize that the background choir is a group of people singing the single word Christmas over and over in a monotone the effect being almost oppressive In contrast Love s individual vocal is marvelously expressive her voice caressing and playing with every word every syllable In this new light the details of the season can be seen as constant tugs to involve the singer in the traditional social events of the season to give up her feelings of loneliness and isolation to go with the flow With this tension in mind let s see how the conflict plays out and reaches resolution The song opens quietly Strings quaver in the background foreshadowing the emotions to come Christmas bells ring on the beat A lonely halting bass line climbs the scale and then descends repeatedly We work our way through the simple chord structure for one verse Then the drums accelerate and launch us into the first vocal verse The vocal verses are richly layered Multiple percussion instruments play interlocking rhythms strings play counterpoint to the vocal what sounds like a saxophone is used to add to the rhythmic surge Darlene Love s magnificent vocal soars in and around the pounding rhythms like a surfer working her way through heavy swells just beyond the reach of the undertow harnessing all that power playing with it A saxophone solo serves as punctuation It is rich and warm reminding us of the intimacy lost the closeness needed but no longer available Another chorus then the final verse Darlene Love s voice quivers on the final word of each line as if on the verge of tears near breakdown If there was a way I d hold back this tear but it s Christmas Day please Now the background singers echo her plea Please The call and response continues accelerates trading this one word back and forth faster and faster a piano now building in the background begging for release gradually climbing the scale the pounding of the drums accelerating until Darlene finally explodes Baby please come home The piano soars now Darlene repeats her request The drums run free no longer just carrying the beat but improvising as the power of the climax winds down into release Conflict between seasonal reminders and personal feelings are resolved as the singer expresses her emotions fully and completely Liberated from all restraint she pours her true emotions out honestly and openly without shame or remorse It s instructive to compare this recording to another belonging to a prior generation but with very similar lyric and thematic content One For My Baby And One More For The Road was one of Frank Sinatra s favorite songs This is a similar tale Boy meets girl Boy loses girl Boy misses girl And similarly the tension in this song is also between the need to control and suppress one s feelings and the need to express them The setting for the Sinatra song though is in a quiet bar late at night The singer is able to express his feelings only to the bartender and only after several drinks He expresses his feelings with great restraint referring to them indirectly saying that he has to tell someone or he soon might explode Given all these similarities what is interesting is how different the two recordings are The resolution of the Sinatra song is in the bar closing the singer getting himself under control successfully suppressing his feelings The resolution of the Spector song is in the singer completely expressing and releasing her feelings Whereas Sinatra successfully avoids an explosion Love successfully explodes The lyrics to the Sinatra song are clever and ironic The lyrics to the Spector song are direct and effective Sinatra offers a wonderful interpretation of One For My Baby playing the part almost as an actor might Love simply uses the words and melody as a starting point with the real effect coming in the arrangement and vocal delivery Instrumental backing for the Sinatra song is spare and low key echoing the reserve of the singer and emphasizing the understated irony of the lyrics Instrumentation for the Spector song is rich and multi layered representing the powerful opposing forces at work in the song and the ultimate emotional release of the singer All in all this masterpiece from Spector and Love is a wonderful example of the new aesthetic offered by rock music https www reasontorock com elements overview html BTW much like Frank Capra s It s A Wonderful Life the initial release of the original recording did not have any significant commercial success but has since become something of a Christmas standard The song was later covered by many artists and David Letterman invited Darlene Love to perform the song on his annual Christmas show every year for 29 years beginning in 1986

air as if waiting for an answer to a question Matthews vocals then come in over this guitar figure and then continue to play with it over the course of the song in interesting often surprising ways Note that the length and rhyming pattern of the verses vary as the song progresses this seems to be an intentional device to keep the listener paying attention in line with Matthews overall challenge to the listener to not take this story for granted to not assume we already know everything about it Matthews starts with lyrics that serve to humanize Jesus and his parents to bring them up to date and perhaps to sneak up on his audience a bit nothing in the first four lines betray any traditional words or images associated with Christ But then Matthews shows his hand with a reference to the three Wise Men and concludes with references to being surrounded by love > She was his girl he was her boyfriend > Soon to be his wife make him her husband > A surprise on the way any day any day > One healthy little giggling dribbling baby boy > The Wise Men came three made their way > To shower him with love while he lay in the hay > Shower him with love love love > Love love love > Love love was all around Matthews then goes on to quickly summarize the years between Christ s birth and his crucifixion again using modern language that helps to both humanize and update the image of Jesus for us and again concluding with a reference to love now in the heart of Christ and surrounding him > Not very much of his childhood was known > Kept his mother Mary worried always out on his own > He met another Mary who for a reasonable fee > Less than reputable was known to be > His heart was full of love love love > Love love love > Love love was all around Matthews next jumps to the scene of Jesus talking to his father from the cross expressing doubts about what he has accomplished while on earth Again the language is intentionally modern and avoids any overt religious references But now in line with the doubts expressed this verse ends with blood all around not love > When Jesus Christ was nailed to his tree > Said Oh Daddy o I can see how it all soon will be > I came to shed a little light on this darkening scene > Instead I fear I ve spilled the blood of my children all around > The blood of my children all around > The blood of my children s all around Matthews then drops from a third person omniscient voice to a personal first person perspective He confesses that this story is what he s been told implying that it is not necessarily true and so stepping back from speaking with any semblance of religious authority The singer now addresses his listeners directly and explicitly states that the people Christ knew did not seem to be the stalwart pillars of society but rather people like us > So I m told so the story goes > The people he knew were > Less than golden hearted > Gamblers and robbers > Drinkers and jokers > All soul searchers > Like you and me > Like you and me And now perhaps as another device to keep the listener from becoming complacent the singer returns to the story of Christ but at a point preceding the crucifixion He talks about those who take Jesus into custody but in line with Christ s admonishment to forgive them for they know not what they do the singer does not judge the authorities harshly but says only that they were less informed and were also soul searchers searching for love > Rumors insisted he soon would be > For his deviations taken into custody > By the authorities less informed than he > Drinkers and jokers all soul searchers > Searching for love love love > Love love love > Love love was all around Matthews now continues the story reaching the point at which Christ asks his followers to eat bread as a remembrance of his body but Matthews now offers up the wine as a symbol of the blood of our children all around as a remembrance of the pain and suffering we inflict on innocents > Preparations were made > For his celebration day > He said Eat this bread think of it as me > Drink this wine and dream it will be > The blood of our children all around > The blood of our children all around > The blood of our children s all around And now the singer asks the final question seeking the answer for which he has been searching And at this point the singer could be Jesus or he could be Matthews Certainly though we feel that this is Dave Matthews asking in his own voice > Father up above > Why in all this hatred do you fill me up with love love love > Love love love > Love love love > Love love was all around > > Father up above > Why in all this anger do you fill me up with love > Fill me love love yeah > Love love love > Love love and the blood of our children all around And so like the guitar figure that has run throughout the whole song we end on a question When there is so much hate and suffering in the world why do we find ourselves filled with love And filled with this love but facing the blood of our children all around how are we called upon to act This is a beautiful song and a very unusual one in its lack of certainty its lack of an upbeat conclusive musical signature and its unadorned unapologetic repetition of the word love This is a song that calls out to us not to enjoy the holidays but to question the deeper meaning of the traditions we are performing it s a singer and a song asking us not just to feel love but to ask ourselves what we will do with it Like the Christmas songs of Ray Davies rd and Jackson Browne jb this is a call to open

t make the winter babe that s dry long so > You better come on in my kitchen > Cause it s goin to be rainin outdoors And then listen to Johnson s recording using your preferred music source Note that the pace of the song is slow and measured the tone of Johnson s delivery is deeply felt and the accompanying guitar is delicate even if stinging at times So whereas the lines that he sings could be interpreted to be suggestive or leering or sexually assertive his delivery conveys none of this Johnson begins the song by humming the first two lines of the first verse This does a couple of things it allows him to suggest a depth of feeling that is not yet associated with any particular characters or events and it allows the repeated refrain to be delivered as the first words of the song placing the thematic emphasis on the refrain rather than the events described later The events of the song are not quite connected enough to form a linear story Instead they seem to describe a condition The women in the song go from one situation to another one liaison to another with little or no power or resources of their own no lasting relationships no security At its most narrow this could be the condition of black women in the American South in the early 1900 s but there are no details in the song other than what we know about the singer himself to restrict our focus this narrowly Certainly the song could easily be considered to be about the fate of women in any age and any society The refrain itself is wonderful in its simplicity and its resonance What is the singer offering Certainly in the context of the song one does not expect that the offer is being made out of pure generosity or sympathy for the woman s condition yet the fact that no strings are overtly attached leaves the offer mysterious open ended And the line It s going to be raining outdoors is rich with symbolism and drama suggesting that the woman will need protection from the elements will need a relationship with the singer Two lines in the middle of the song are softly spoken rather than sung when Johnson asks Oh can t you hear the wind howl then uses his guitar to evoke the sound of the approaching storm The effect again is to dramatize the plight of the woman who has no place to stay no protection It is important to note that while the words of the song are tremendously simple this simplicity is not constrictive but rather suggestive It is not that Johnson has little to say but that he has suggested so much with so few words With a few bold lines he has drawn a simple sketch yet one that clearly outlines a world of shifting and uncertain relationships a world of setbacks and disappointments a world that cares little for the plight of a single woman and yet a world that also includes this offer of protection this open door into the singer s kitchen The notes of the song rise and fall pausing and then moving on fittingly representing the circumstances of the woman s life Johnson s voice is rich and moving with his guitar lines fitting like a glove to a hand supporting and extending his vocals suggesting a delicate frailty Note too that while Johnson s vocals are emotional the emotions are much more than simple transient reactions to a single person in a particular time place and situation they are deeply felt filled with ancient wisdom sadness and power as Dylan says of Johnson Neither forlorn or hopeless or shackled Dylan 2004 It is interesting to see how much variation Johnson uses in this simple song structure He hums the first two lines Later on in the song he speaks two lines instead of singing them And when singing Lookin for her good friend none can be found note how he varies his accompaniment using his guitar to match the vocal melody seemingly emphasizing the sadness of the song Just for fun let s see if we can find some echoes of this simple Johnson song in later works of rock music John Lennon uses the weather and a similarly simple set of words to describe a universal condition in Rain Dylan uses an approaching storm and a similarly open ended dramatic situation in All Along the Watchtower Dylan uses a similarly simple refrain based on the weather in Blowing in the Wind and A Hard Rain s A Gonna Fall And the tone of Johnson towards the woman in this song seems similar to the tone of Dylan towards a woman in hardship in Like A Rolling Stone Like many of Johnson s tracks Come On In My Kitchen is a masterwork in which words vocals and guitar parts are all perfectly crafted to deliver a single unified artistic effect Those who followed him would spend hours days weeks and months surrounded by sophisticated recording equipment trying to achieve similar effects emulating this almost unknown bluesman whose only opportunities for immortality were a few hours in makeshift recording studios hastily set up in hotel rooms Yet those few hours were enough for Johnson to alter the course of music decades later As one of his students admitted > If I hadn t heard the Robert Johnson record when I did there probably > would have been hundreds of lines of mine that would have been shut > down that I wouldn t have felt free enough or upraised enough to > write Bob Dylan Dylan 2004 Dylan 2004 Bob Dylan Chronicles Volume One Simon Schuster 2004"

        content: "This song was written by Tom Waits http www tomwaits com and his performance of the song on his 1999 album Mule Variations is certainly worth hearing His delivery sounds like that of a down at the heels preacher delivering the holy message at a revival meeting or perhaps on a street corner with a Salvation Army style brass band playing in the background He delivers his sermon with an unarguable power and authority My introduction to the song however came during the encore performance by Sarah Jarosz https www sarahjarosz com at the Tractor Tavern http www tractortavern com a couple of years ago I can still remember the looks on the faces of Sarah and her band as they delivered the song to the standing swaying crowd seemingly amazed at the depth of feeling and the bond between performer and audience being wrought within the house that night as all present returned again and again to the chorus with increasing emotional commitment You can find other artists paying homage to this wonderful work by Waits as well but my favorite is still the one that Jarosz and her esteemed compatriots delivered on the album Song Up In Her Head If you haven t heard it yet give it a listen now Waits begins his song with lines that evoke the strongest possible sense of dislocation of disharmony > Well the moon is broken > And the sky is cracked And with these two simple lines he paints a picture not just of heartbreak and human tragedy but of a shattered cosmos In other hands this would be a prelude to an expression of existential despair but in the very next line Waits instead offers a seeming remedy > Come on up to the house And then in the next two lines he suggests that the person he addresses is suffering from a distorted perspective > The only things that you can see > Is all that you lack And then of course he offers the same suggestion > Come on up to the house In the next verse he makes it clear that he is not recommending any sort of martyrdom and is certainly not sympathetic to those with a traditionally Christian solution to the problem and is still interested in practical matters of daily life Quite a lot of meaning to pack into a mere seventeen words if we exclude the repeated admonition to Come on up to the house > All your crying don t do no good > Come on up to the house > Come down off the cross > We can use the wood > Come on up to the house And now after the first two verses we get to the chorus > You got to come on up to the house > Come on up to the house > The world is not my home > I m just a passin through > Come on up to the house Again of course we hear this repeated injunction but now with this additional clarification The world is not my home I m just passing through And so Waits seems to be saying even if traditional religions offer no help and even if we are properly focused on solving the daily problems of living here on earth we need to be cognizant of some higher calling something greater than this broken world we inhabit Waits is at his imaginative playful best in the next two verses painting the direst most fanciful images depicting his audience s situation even managing to work in Thomas Hobbes description of the natural state of mankind https yalebooksblog co uk 2013 04 05 thomas hobbes solitary poor nasty brutish and short bereft of any form of human society as described in his book Leviathan https en wikipedia org wiki Leviathan Hobbes book first published in 1651 > There s no light in the tunnel > No irons in the fire > Come on up to the house > And you re singing lead soprano > In a junkman s choir > You gotta come on up to the house > > Does life seem nasty brutish and short > Come on up to the house > The seas are stormy > And you can t find no port > Come on up to the house After another delivery of the chorus Waits has two more verses for us now seeming to more personally address his listener s inner state > There s nothing in the world > That you can do > Come on up to the house > You been whipped by the forces > that are inside you > Come on up to the house > Well you re high on top > Of your mountain of woe > Come on up to the house > Well you know you should surrender > But you can t let go > Come on up to the house Another delivery of the chorus some ending fanfare and then we are done So what are we left with What is the meaning of this repeated phrase Come on up to the house Well first of all the word up is interesting because Waits is certainly inviting us to some more elevated circumstance than the one his audience is currently enjoying And his word house is suggestive since it s often used to describe the house of the lord but here seems to be used in a more familiar sense as if simply welcoming his listener to drop by the singer s home Overall the singer seems to be inviting us to be part of a human community based on some shared if still mysterious sense of unity and connection If the words to the song seem mysterious then perhaps they are intentionally so I am reminded of some words from Albert Einstein http en wikipedia org wiki Albert Einstein from his book The World As I See It https www amazon com World As I See dp 1494877066 ref=as li ss tl encoding=UTF8 qid=1503082400 sr=8 1 linkCode=ll1 tag=wordsaboutsongs 20 linkId=748ce9f0d5ec6c52435b29a2e5418886 written in 1949 > The most beautiful experience we can have is the mysterious It is the fundamental emotion that stands at the cradle of true art and true science Whoever does not know it and can no longer wonder no longer marvel is as good as dead and his eyes are dimmed It was the experience of mystery even if mixed with fear that engendered religion A knowledge of the existence of something we cannot penetrate our perceptions of the profoundest reason and the most radiant beauty which only in their most primitive forms are accessible to our minds it is this knowledge and this emotion that constitute true religiosity In this sense and only this sense I am a deeply religious man And also from his book Religion and Science > The religious geniuses of all ages have been distinguished by this kind of cosmic religious feeling which knows no dogma and no God conceived in man s image so that there can be no church whose central teachings are based on it Hence it is precisely among the heretics of every age that we find men who were filled with this highest kind of religious feeling and were in many cases regarded by their contemporaries as atheists sometimes also as saints For me this song hints at the same type of mysterious transcendent unity that Einstein describes I m going to file this one under Hymns of Secular Humanism right along with Hallelujah by Leonard Cohen"

        summary: "<p>I’ve been wondering lately why I’ve never written an appreciation for any of Warren Zevon’s songs. It’s certainly not that he didn’t give us many great tracks to choose from. </p>", 
        content: "I ve been wondering lately why I ve never written an appreciation for any of Warren Zevon s songs It s certainly not that he didn t give us many great tracks to choose from Upon reflection perhaps it s because he wrote so many compact little gems that it s hard to pick just one Whatever the reason this song of his has been haunting me lately so it s time to correct the omission Part of Zevon s genius as a lyricist was his ability to invest ordinary material objects with such deep feelings This song is an outstanding example It s so simple so short and yet the words and images resonate like stones skipped onto the water with meaning spreading out in expanding ripples I m going to share the lyrics in their entirety before commenting and of course I encourage you to listen to Zevon s recording as well > I was sitting in the Hollywood Hawaiian Hotel > I was staring in my empty coffee cup > I was thinking that the gypsy wasn t lying > All the salty margaritas in Los Angeles > I m gonna drink em up > > And if California slides into the ocean > Like the mystics and statistics say it will > I predict this motel will be standing > Until I pay my bill > > Don t the sun look angry through the trees > Don t the trees look like crucified thieves > Don t you feel like desperados under the eaves > Heaven help the one who leaves > > Still wakin up in the mornings with shakin hands > And I m tryin to find a girl who understands me > But except in dreams you re never really free > Don t the sun look angry at me > > I was sitting in the Hollywood Hawaiian Hotel > I was listening to the air conditioner hum > It went mm mm mm mm > > Humming > > Look away down Gower Avenue repeated through the fade out And now let s break it down > I was sitting in the Hollywood Hawaiian Hotel One line how much can we say about it Well first of all it s important to note that the Hollywood Hawaiian hotel was a real place https losangelesexplorersguild com 2021 05 21 hollywood hawaiian hotel and that Zevon and other musicians of the day often stayed there especially when they couldn t afford the slightly more upscale Tropicana down the street When Zevon would have written this song he was touring occasionally in support of other acts and doing some session work so we can easily imagine him taking up residence at a somewhat seedy hotel in Hollywood waiting for his next paying gig But even without knowing these details just the name of the place has an interesting connotation of borrowed decor and of an attempt to project an image that might be somewhat different than the reality of the place > I was staring in my empty coffee cup With this single line Zevon seems to imply that he s sitting alone without connection without funds and without prospects but with ample time on his hands > I was thinking that the gypsy wasn t lying We don t know who the gypsy is but we don t need to know the term by itself suggests an impermanent itinerant way of life and when the singer says she wasn t lying there s the suggestion of a fortune teller predicting the singer s future > All the salty margaritas in Los Angeles > I m gonna drink em up Is this an affirmation of Zevon s intent Or part of the gypsy s prediction Perhaps both But it certainly paints a wider picture of the availability of this omnipresent Southern California cocktail serving to tempt thirsty drinkers such as Zevon wherever they go offering a chilled drink an alcoholic buzz plus the satisfying tang of a salty rim And again as with the Hawaiian hotel the reference to this originally Mexican drink further reinforces the imported ersatz nature of life in LA > And if California slides into the ocean > Like the mystics and statistics say it will Notice how these long meandering descending lines mirror the meaning of the words > I predict this motel will be standing > Until I pay my bill And now after gradually widening the scope of the lyrics geographically from Hollywood to Los Angeles to California and temporally from the empty coffee cup before him to a prediction of further cocktail consumption to the contemplation of some possible future geographic catastrophe Zevon abruptly and masterfully returns our attention to his current predicament and personally most pressing prediction Notice too how the shorter line length and quick occurrence of the rhyming bill reinforces this sense of an abrupt return to current reality > Don t the sun look angry through the trees Again we have this connection of a very real material object to the singer s personal feelings But anyone who s looked out at a sun setting over the Pacific Ocean at the end of a hot day especially if not filtered or reflected via clouds knows how angry such an orb can look > Don t the trees look like crucified thieves And now it seems we have a Biblical reference perhaps to the thieves who were crucified next to Christ With Zevon s mother having come from a Mormon family we can easily imagine the parental condemnation that might be felt for Zevon s hedonistic Southern California lifestyle > Don t you feel like desperados under the eaves And now for the first time Zevon makes reference to companions to others similarly situated perhaps to others sitting with him either drinking coffee or sharing a pitcher of margaritas But he s also breaking the fourth wall https en wikipedia org wiki Fourth wall speaking directly to the audience asking us how we feel suggesting that we as listeners are also in some ways sharing the singer s situation So however much we might have distanced ourselves from the singer leading up to this line Zevon now draws us in with this romantic image suggesting that we re all somewhat desperate and reckless sitting in this exposed situation under the eaves of a building but not inside of it not fully sheltered by it and perhaps somehow on the fringes of established respectable society > Heaven help the one who leaves Again Zevon suggests as was likely the case for him personally that there were others like him in this same situation in this same location And he further suggests here that they are all part of something like a mutual support group And of course the first to achieve success to break out of this mode of existence to move into fancier digs will be also estranging himself from the group drawing a line between himself and the others It may help to know that Jackson Browne David Lindley Bonnie Raitt Carl Wilson Don Henley Glen Frey J D Souther Phil Everly Stevie Nicks and others all contributed to Zevon s first album on which this track appears So this supportive band of brothers and sisters many of whom achieved earlier and greater success than Zevon and who a year or two earlier had been in similar circumstances was a very real group > Still waking up in the mornings with shaking hands > And I m trying to find a girl who understands me Now Zevon returns to his more personal more troubled circumstances suffering from substance abuse estranged from intimate relationships > But except in dreams you re never really free > Don t the sun look angry at me And now he seems to retreat from his romantic imaginings and imagery coming back to reality confessing that unlike his conjured desperados he cannot be free cannot escape his past and his personal demons > I was sitting in the Hollywood Hawaiian Hotel > I was listening to the air conditioner hum Now Zevon returns us to the original scene the place from which he began this reverie that he s just shared with us And now rather than focusing on romantic images from nature he s simply listening to the drone of the nearby air conditioner helping to dull the heat of a Southern California day And now something amazing happens to the song to the singer and to us The singer begins to hum and this humming and the musical accompaniment behind it now repeats and swells and builds repeating the words look away and directing our attention down Gower Avenue There is not a Gower Avenue in LA but North Gower Street runs through Hollywood running westwards So if we look away we might see the Pacific and the upscale communities of Beverly Hills and Bel Air But the reference to Gower also brings up memories of Gower Gulch https en wikipedia org wiki Gower Gulch the location of many of the original Hollywood film studios including Columbia So in the final moments of the song our singer enjoins himself and us to change our perspective to raise our gaze from what s immediately before us to some more distant horizon And he does this just with a few repeated words and with swelling ascendant music The music suggests sadness but also some form of hope One can certainly read this song as a simple personal entry in Zevon s musical autobiography firmly rooted in a particular place and time and personality But it s also a beautiful poignant heartfelt paean to Zevon s adopted city and to those who choose to live there out on the edge of our country people who build their lives and works and homes out of little more than their deepest desires and most fevered imaginings in the face of past and likely future catastrophe building a culture and region out of borrowed bits and pieces but somehow fusing them together into a dream city that repeatedly captures the imaginings of people all across our nation and globe whether it s watching the Rose Bowl on New Year s Day or visiting Disneyland or listening to The Beach Boys or viewing the stars on Hollywood Boulevard I lived in Los Angeles for ten years after college I started my career there and met my wife there And my first two weeks there were in the guest room of a college friend s parents who lived in Pacific Palisades I find myself grieving today for all that s been lost recently in the LA area but also feeling faith in the people and spirit of this city as captured so potently by Warren Zevon in this song And looking forward to a salty margarita there the next time my wanderings lead me back"

        content: "Chief among this song s many pleasures is Ray Davies largely successful attempt to encapsulate the entire history of human civilization within the first three verses The recording is also an excellent example of how Ray can change characters and perspectives many times within the same song In addition the song demonstrates Ray s ability to shield his main theme within multiple layers of story and character until he is ready to fully state it In this way he keeps us as listeners always amused yet always off guard never quite sure where he is headed until he suddenly reveals his underlying intentions The opening drums along with slashing guitar and organ chords are slow powerful and raw suggesting primitive forces running loose at the dawn of creation This accompaniment is almost immediately replaced however by a cautious cantering piano riff The effect is something like a zoom shot at the beginning of a film with the initial view providing perspective and location gradually moving in for a close up of our main character Ray s voice starts off quietly and gently again sounding timid like the piano > In a deep dark jungle > Long time ago > Lived a lonesome caveman > He was a solitary soul We are immediately given the problem to be solved human isolation Ray now elaborates adding comic touches as he goes letting us know that he is pulling our leg > And he spent his playtime > Chewing meat from bones > He didn t know how to talk much > He only knew how to groan We shift to minor chords and a more insistent beat now adding a sense of drama to the accompanying words > Then he lifted up his hands and reached to the sky > Let out a yell and no one replied > Frustration and torment tore him inside > Then he fell to the ground and he cried and he cried Now just when the Kinks have us genuinely worried about this poor soul the humorous upbeat chorus kicks in abruptly announcing his salvation Again they are letting us know that they are still only kidding and that the real point is yet to come > But then Education saved the day > He learned to speak and communicate > Education saved the day > He thanked God for the friends he made We shift tones again the rest of the chorus unfolding quietly giving us the first foreshadowing of the real purpose of the song still as yet unexplained Ray s voice turns appropriately wise and knowing at this point playing the mature modern liberal > Cause everybody needs an education > Everybody needs an education > Black skin red skin yellow or white > Everybody needs to read and write > Everybody needs an education The second verse starts now but actually with a different chord structure melody and accompaniment much more urgent than the quiet opening verse The driving beat propels us along > Thank the day when that primitive man > Learned to talk with his brothers > And live off the land > He left his cave and he moved far away > And he lived with his friends in a house that they d made > He learned to think and to work with his brain > And he astounded his friends with all the knowledge he gained > He wrote it down on a rock that he found > And he showed all his friends and they passed it around The progress of the song is speeding up now again reminding us of similar cinematic effects such as pages quickly turning on a calendar Our caveman is already building houses living with roommates and impressing friends with his vast knowledge We now skip any kind of chorus and effectively go directly to the next verse maintaining the sense of onrushing forward momentum > Well man built a boat and he learned how to sail > And he traveled far and wide > Then he looked up above saw the stars in the sky > So he learned how to fly The rapid progress of the song is now almost dizzying The sense is of man confidently conquering all of nature and bending it to his will Quite a change from the lone caveman nearly overwhelmed by his primitive environment only a verse or two ago The tone and perspective suddenly shift now Using a biting sarcastic tone and sounding like a contemporary young punk Ray spits out the next ungrateful words > Thanks to all the mathematicians > And the inventors with their high IQs > And the professors in their colleges > Trying to feed me knowledge > That I know I ll never use Continuing in the same vein but with a more considered and reasonable tone Ray goes on > Thank you sir for the millions of words > That you ve handed me down and you ve told me to learn > But I ve got words in my ears and my eyes > I ve got so many facts that I must memorize Ray now goes on to the upbeat chorus but with altered words At this point he is comically playing the modern man now overwhelmed not by the forces of nature but by the massive accumulation of human knowledge > Because education s doing me in > I want to stop but my head s in a swim > Education drives me insane > I can t recall all the facts on my brain Ray now quickly reverts to his previous gratitude for the social benefits of education contrasting it with the cynicism just displayed and the more serious note to follow > Education came that day > The day it came was a sacred day > Education saved the day > He thanked God for all the friends he made Ray now reveals his real purpose delivering the following words without any comic accents or overtones but with straightforward earnestness for the first time in the song > Teacher teach me how to read and write > You can teach me bout biology > But you can t tell me what I am living for > Cause that s still a mystery > Teacher teach me about nuclear physics > And teach me about the structure of man > But all your endless calculations > Can t tell me why I am > No you can t tell me why I am Note how our hero has come full circle Starting out physically isolated from other people he now has all the knowledge and communication abilities of modern civilization at his command Yet he finds himself still alone unable to divine his own purpose for existence from any outside source having only his own internal resources to call upon Dave Davies takes a piercingly lovely guitar solo at this point gradually ascending the scale but with adorning flourishes and embellishments along the way The solo perfectly expresses the inability of words or of any civilized structure to adequately communicate the essence of a single individual The purpose of even a single human life cannot be expressed in words its mystery touched upon only by this haunting musical expression The main theme of the song now successfully delivered the Kinks retreat back into humor delivering the following lyrics with comic bombast The word education is now repeated almost as a chant at the end of every line The reasonable modern liberal tone taken earlier is now exaggerated the implicit condescension now brought out into the open > Everybody needs education > Open Universities education > Every race every creed education > And every little half breed education > Every nationality education > All the little people need education > Eskimos and pygmies need > And even aborigines education The song now speeds up heading for its big finish Typical school subjects are listed in the lyrics still accompanied by the ongoing education chant Finally just the one word is repeated over and over until the song finally slides to a melodramatic close Again looking for cinematic comparisons I am reminded of some of Frank Capra s great films Like Capra the Kinks offers a message of humanism and individuality Also like this great American film director the Kinks use humor to lighten their fundamentally serious tone to win the audience s sympathy and to misdirect the viewer listener making the serious scenes all the more effective when they finally come The overall progression of the song of course is one of liberation liberation from ignorance powerlessness and isolation initially followed by liberation from the dominating influence of modern bureaucrats educators and intellectuals who insist they know what is best for us Almost paradoxically but utterly true to rock s fundamental methods and principles we are simultaneously liberated from isolation into cooperation and from conformity into individuality The liberation discussed in the lyrics is more than mirrored by the freedom taken with the structure of the song The Kinks use the pop conventions of chorus and verse here only in their loosest sense freely adapting the chords melody tempo and accompaniment as they go along to suit the intent of the lyrics As with many great rock recordings the effect is one of breaking down artificial boundaries and limitations sprawling past the normal guidelines and breaking out of past constraints"

        content: "The beginning of the song is a study in understatement An electric guitar plays two notes slowly repeated with tremolo The drums set up a quiet pulse like beat An acoustic guitar enters strumming two chords then beginning a quiet riff that is a definition of laid back L A funk Finally Steve Stills voice enters in a quiet conversational tone > There s something happening here > What it is ain t exactly clear > There s a man with a gun over there > Telling me I got to beware > I think it s time we stop children what s that sound > Everybody look what s going down Notice how the first two lines draw the listener in and create suspense The singer says that something is happening but we don t yet have any idea what it is The next two lines up the ante saying that there is a man with a gun involved but maintain the suspense since we don t know who the man is why he has a gun or what he intends to do with it The chorus then summarizes what we know so far and issues a request for attention to some force that is threatening the singer s community The term children is interesting since it suggests youth and innocence and reinforces the notion of a group needing protection Overall the first verse presents the central tension of the song the contrast between the drama of the situation on one hand and the emotional reserve of the singer and the music on the other The second verse gives some context to the dramatic confrontation presented in the first verse > There s battle lines being drawn > Nobody s right if everybody s wrong > Young people speaking their minds > Getting so much resistance from behind > It s time we stop hey what s that sound > Everybody look what s going down Notice that the issues generating the controversy are not identified Seemingly they are not of importance to the singer What is important is the increasing polarization and intensity of the situation the fear and anger being generated The emotional reserve of the singer now begins to make more sense since the singer is suggesting that cooler heads prevail that people stop and look at what they are creating The musical accompaniment suggests movement and increasing intensity Neil Young plays an electric guitar break between the end of this chorus and the beginning of the next verse While the pace is still sedate and the volume low the addition of the electric guitar part does indicate that something is indeed happening and the tremolo and bent notes give some premonition of what is to come The next verse provides even more context giving our first details of a specific event since the mention of the man with a gun in the first verse > What a field day for the heat > A thousand people in the street > Singing songs and carrying signs > Mostly say Hooray for our side > It s time we stop hey what s that sound > Everybody look what s going down It is interesting to see all the meanings of the word heat that are invoked in the first line First it could refer to the actual temperature on the streets in L A Second it could refer to an intensity of emotion or to pressure and stress Third it is a slang term for a pistol and thus serves as a reminder of the gun mentioned in the first verse Fourth it is a slang term for the police finally giving some identity to the man with the gun All these meanings resonate with the listener given the context of the song Again the singer intentionally affirms the irrelevance of the issues being discussed by referring to songs and signs mostly saying hooray for our side without any further identification of what the sides represent At the same time he is again pointing out the divisiveness of the conflict The music continues to intensify in this verse with ominously descending background vocals behind Stills voice Young s guitar at the end of the chorus is again restrained but with the stretched notes intensifying suggesting a sort of distortion or transformation taking place The fourth and final verse makes the singer s warning explicit > Paranoia strikes deep > Into your life it will creep > It starts when you re always afraid > You step out of line the man come and take you away As suggested earlier the singer s concern is about the loss of innocence and the introduction of violence and fear into his community The music pulls out all the stops now with background vocals behind all of Stills lyrics hand claps added for percussive effect and Young s distorted guitar playing throughout the verse The song concludes with Stills and background singers repeating the chorus several times with minor variations in lyrics and melody each time Young s guitar continues in the background seemingly representing the chaos and destruction potentially being unleashed The guitar continues after the vocals are done then fades out leaving the stated threat hanging unvanquished Note that the title of the song For What It s Worth appears nowhere in the song s lyrics Instead it serves to comment on the situation being addressed further cooling down the emotional environment by suggesting that the worth of the opinions being expressed can best be evaluated by the listener Rock is often accused of being loud overbearing aggressive and violent And yet here we have a song where folk and country western traditions are used to undercut and restrain those very tendencies in fact to warn of their dangers The beauty of this song is that it manages to warn of increasing polarization and violence in American society without taking any stand other than that of acceptance of diversity and free speech In other words it comments on politics without itself being political And while Stills includes comments on authority he seems to mainly address his peers subtly warning that strident defense of their positions and attacks against their opponents might threaten the very freedoms attitudes and life styles they are seeking to protect In retrospect one has to give prophetic credit to Stills song It was only a few years later when Stills and Young along with new partners Crosby and Nash would release Young s composition Ohio Featuring the lyrics Tin Soldiers and Nixon coming We re finally on our own and ending with the terrible refrain Four dead in Ohio the song memorialized four students who had been shot dead at Kent State University during a protest against the Viet Nam war By this time the violent confrontation and polarization warned of in For What It s Worth had sadly come to pass It s interesting to see how the presentation of For What It s Worth evolved in later years The CSN Y live album Four Way Street presents the same song with Stills accompanying himself on piano and with vocals that are positively histrionic when compared with the laid back singing of the original recording By 1971 it seems the emotional reserve of the original could no longer be maintained even though the message still needed to be heard more than ever"

        content: "From the Dictionary app on my iMac > fruitcake > 1 A cake containing dried fruit and nuts > 2 informal an eccentric or insane person I ve always considered Fruitcakes to be Jimmy Buffet s masterwork The musical backing is infectious swaying and danceable and the background vocals add depth The words are cleverly crafted and perfectly suited to Buffett s conversational wisecracking delivery The song is from 1993 and contains some dated references but these just add to the fun for me The singer starts with a spoken introduction setting up the verses that will follow > You know I was talking to my friend Desdemona the other day She runs this space station bake shop down near Boomtown She told me that human beings are flawed individuals that the cosmic bakers took us out of the oven a little too early and that s the reason we re as crazy as we are and I believe it Note what Buffett is doing here First of all he establishes the existence of a network of friends who talk to each other regularly He does this not only by referencing a conversation with Desdemona but by talking to the listener in the same vein thus inviting us into this same circle He also establishes the diversity and eccentricity of the individuals in this circle with his description of a space station bake shop owned by his friend Desdemona He also introduces a framing metaphor the idea that the cosmic bakers took us out of the oven a little too early And so in a single sentence he comes up with his own origin story explaining human fallibility one of the foundational elements of any religion And even though he has not yet referenced the title word he s already leveraged its meaning in both senses referring to both human eccentrics and baked goods Now the singer continues speaking giving us an example of his own eccentricity > Take for example when you go to the movies these days you know they try to sell you this jumbo drink 8 extra ounces of watered down Cherry Coke for an extra 25 cents I don t want it I don t want that much organization in my life I don t want other people thinking for me I want my Junior Mints Where did the Junior Mints go in the movies I don t want a 12 lb Nestle s crunch for 25 dollars I WANT JUNIOR MINTS We need more fruitcakes in this world and less bakers We need people that care I m mad as hell And I don t want to take it anymore network And so although this rant offers an example of the singer s own eccentricity it also advances the proposition that individuals with all their imperfections and eccentricities are preferable to an ethos of standardized corporate consumerism We now transition to the words being sung instead of spoken with the first appearance of the song s chorus > Fruitcakes in the kitchen Fruitcakes in the kitchen > Fruitcakes on the street Fruitcakes on the street > Strutting naked through the crosswalk > In the middle of the week > Half baked cookies in the oven Cookies in the oven > Half baked people on the bus People on the bus > There s a little bit of fruitcake left in every one of us And here Buffett fully reveals the song s core proposition that we humans are all a little half baked all fruitcakes of one variety or another Now we get a series of verses each offering a different sort of example of this nuttiness with the chorus repeated at suitable intervals > Paradise lost and found > Paradise take a look around > I was out in California where I hear they have it all > They got riots fires and mud slides > They ve got sushi in the mall > Water bars brontosaurs Chinese modern lust > Shake and bake life with the quake > The secret s in the crust Note that the phrases shake and bake and the secret s in the crust are both references to advertising slogans of the day as well as being hijacked in this context to refer to the frequency of California earthquakes > Speakin of fruitcakes how bout the government > Your tax dollars at work > > We lost our Martian rocket ship > The high paid spokesman said > Looks like that silly rocket ship > Has lost its cone shaped head > We spent 90 jillion dollars trying to get a look at Mars > I hear universal laughter ringing out among the stars The cone shaped head phrase is a reference to the Coneheads snl featured in Saturday Night Live sketches for many years as well as a movie released in the same year as this song Note also that the image of universal laughter ringing out among the stars is another way of putting this song in the sort of broad philosophical context usually reserved for religions Buffett further emphasizes this cosmic perspective in the next version of the chorus varying the first few lines to say > Fruitcakes in the galaxy > Fruitcakes on the earth > Strutting naked towards eternity > We ve been that way since birth Buffett now addresses religion directly > Spoken > > Religion Religion Oh there s a thin line between Saturday night and Sunday morning > > Here we go now Alright altar boys > > Mea Culpa Mea Culpa Mea Maxima Culpa > Mea Culpa Mea Culpa Mea Maxima Culpa > > Where s the church who took the steeple > Religion s in the hands of some crazy ass people > Television preachers with bad hair and dimples > The god s honest truth is it s not that simple > It s the Buddhist in you it s the Pagan in me > It s the Muslim in him she s Catholic ain t she > It s the born again look it s the WASP and the Jew > Tell me what s goin on I ain t got a clue With the ascent of the religious right in American politics in recent years as well as the controversies over Muslims and diverse religious backgrounds this verse seems as relevant today as it was two and a half decades ago And although the singer professes to his own cluelessness I think Buffett gives us more than a few clues here to fitting together some of the fragmented pieces of our modern culture Buffett takes on romantic relationships in the next verse > Spoken > > Now here comes the big one > > Relationships > > We all got em we all want em What do we do with em > > Here we go I ll tell ya > > She said you ve got to do your fair share > Now cough up half the rent > I treat my body like a temple > You treat yours like a tent > But the right word at the right time > Say give me a little hug > That s the difference between lightning > And a harmless lightning bug Doubting that anything I could say would add anything here I ll quickly move on to the next and final verse of the song > Spoken > > The future > Captain s log star date two thousand and something > > We re seven years from the millennium > That s a science fiction fact > Stanley Kubrick and his buddy Hal > Now don t look that abstract > So I ll put on my Bob Marley tape > And practice what I preach > Get Jah lost in the reggae mon > As I walk along the beach > Stay in touch with my insanity > Really is the only way > It s a jungle out there kiddies > Have a very fruitful day The spoken intro to this last verse obviously references the Star Trek television series and the line about Kubrick and his buddy Hal refers to the film 2001 A Space Odyssey The phrase Bob Marley tape reminds us of cassette tapes and the days of the Sony Walkman before iTunes iPods and iPhones Here Buffett seems to be speaking to us most directly first suggesting some questions about where we re headed as a species then offering himself and his listeners some final words of advice then bidding us good day in his own eccentric fashion and finally leaving us with the image of the singer songwriter philosopher meandering down the beach with his headphones on lost in his reggae tinged world Buffett s not quite done with us yet though We re treated to another delivery of the chorus and then just as he opened with a spoken intro he closes with a spoken outro And then within the outro he brackets another example of a personal rant between admonitions to spread those crumbs around and keep baking baby keep baking > That s right you too Yeah those crumbs are spread all around this universe > > I ve seen fruitcakes I saw this guy in Santa Monica rollerskating naked through the crosswalk Down in New Orleans in the French Market there are fruitcakes like you cannot believe New York forget it Fruitcake city Down Island we ve got Fruitcakes > > Spread them crumbs around That s right we want em around Keep baking baby Keep baking Fruitcakes clocks in at seven minutes and 40 seconds suitable for a rock artist s magnum opus But the pieces all fit together beautifully and there s not a second I would want to remove There s no

        content: "This is a deft example of the songwriter s art Dylan has such an inimitable bag of tricks that many of his songs are unmistakably marked as his either through attitude theme use of language unusual length or some combination of these factors Here though Dylan is like a master magician even after you ve taken away all the props and had him roll up his sleeves he can still effortlessly reach behind your ear and come back with a gold doubloon in his hand No railing against authority here no diverse divergent set of cultural references no rolling series of verses no hallucinatory imagery no put downs no fancy words And yet Dylan still manages to produce a masterpiece Let s review the lyrics It won t take long > Well if you re travelin in the North country fair > Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline > Remember me to one who lives there > She once was a true love of mine > > Well if you go when the snowflakes storm > When the rivers freeze and summer ends > Please see if she s wearing a coat so warm > To keep her from the howlin winds > > Please see for me if her hair hangs long > If it rolls and flows all down her breast > Please see for me if her hair hangs long > That s the way I remember her best > > I m a wonderin if she remembers me at all > Many times I ve often prayed > In the darkness of my night > In the brightness of my day > > So if you re travelin in the North country fair > Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline > Remember me to one who lives there > She once was a true love of mine The first thing to note I think is the physicality of the words and images The words are all short and consist primarily of nouns and verbs There s not a concept or complexity or any kind of abstraction mentioned anywhere in the entire song And what do these words describe There is the soft sensuality of the remembered girl s hair hanging long rolling and flowing all down her breast And then this is contrasted with words describing the harsh winters of the northland with winds hitting heavy the snowflakes storming the freezing rivers the howling wind and the need for the heaviest of coats Although this is a song of remembrance Dylan frames it as a one sided conversation with a third party By doing so he is able to put almost all of his verbs in the present tense And so even though this is a song about a girl that the singer has not seen in a long time almost all of the action of the song is happening in present time He s making a request of someone who is in front of him right now He s asking this third party to see what the girl is doing now to check on her current state And he s wondering right now if she remembers him at all We re not simply looking at an aging photograph of what once was with all the emotional distance and safety implicit in such a situation we re eavesdropping on a private conversation happening right now There s also a timeless quality to the song Even though Dylan wrote the song in the 1960 s the words he used could have been written and could apply to anyplace in the world and almost any time in human history The most technologically advanced item mentioned in the song is a coat This implied lack of technology helps to support the primary dramatic tension of the song For the singer is not in a world where he can send an email to the girl from the North country or text her or jump on a plane and visit her Either due to limitations of technology or finances or some other unmentioned aspect of his situation he is unable to communicate with her directly in any way And yet even though he s not even sure if this girl remembers him even though he harbors no hope of physically reconnecting with her the physical presence they once enjoyed has left him with such caring for her that he is asking someone else to make sure she is well and protected from elements that might threaten her And so this is finally I think the message we are left with that the depth of feeling that one human can feel for another can abide that there is some human bond even if unacknowledged even if one sided even if separated by time and geography that need not fade or diminish that can stand unassailably There are many great versions of this song to choose from Dylan s original version was recorded in 1963 and released as the second track on The Freewheelin Bob Dylan Then a second version a duet with Johnny Cash appeared on Nashville Skyline in 1969 Cash liked the song so well that he included in on the list of essential songs he passed on to his daughter Rosanne and so another version appears on her album The List Leon Russell and Joe Cocker also deliver the song as another duet on the 1970 album Mad Dogs and Englishmen And admittedly the dramatic situation of the song with one man talking to another about a girl that one of them once knew certainly lends itself to a duet featuring two male voices For my money though it s hard to beat the version performed by Sam Bush on his live album Ice Caps Peaks of Telluride with Sam playing mandolin and accompanied by Jerry Douglas on dobro Sam s singing is as poignant as one could wish and the stinging traditional instrumentation adds an urgency to the song that emphasizes its emotional immediacy"

        content: "The history of Leonard Cohen s song Hallelujah is a fascinating one Cohen s songs had never really been embraced by the masses and his first recording of Hallelujah in the early eighties was part of an album so lacking in obvious commercial appeal that the president of CBS Records responded to it by saying What is this This isn t pop music We re not releasing it This is a disaster That recording was released however a little later on a small independent label but few people took note of the album or of this particular song Even for Cohen s small set of fans it did not seem like a particularly memorable recording But then a funny series of events began to play out over the next couple of decades John Cale formerly of the Velvet Underground vu and himself not a household name recorded a version of the song for a Cohen tribute album in 1991 Again few took notice Then singer guitarist Jeff Buckley stumbled across Cale s recording while apartment sitting for a friend and he recorded another version of the song in 1994 Buckley suffered an unfortunate and early demise in 1997 However his recording of the song achieved considerable posthumous critical and commercial recognition Then of all things the song was chosen for use in an animated film a little thing called Shrek Cale s version was used in the film itself but yet another version recorded by Rufus Wainwright was used on the soundtrack Both the film and the album were enormous commercial successes and so the song received exposure to an even wider audience Since then of course the song has been mainlined into our collective consciousness and has been sung recorded and played by just about everyone and used to commemorate just about every sort of occasion Cohen himself performed the song during frequent tours in his later years He was asked at one point whether he was growing tired of hearing so many cover versions especially given the wide range of quality in these various performances and recordings To his credit he responded by saying that he was very happy that it was being sung And so he should have been for a songwriter who cared so deeply about his craft it must have given him great satisfaction to see one of his greatest works being sung and appreciated by so many Cohen had said that he had worked on this particular song for a number of years and at some point had written literally scores of different verses for possible use And in fact Cohen himself performed different versions of the song over the years and the many cover versions often pick and choose particular verses for inclusion Cohen of course like most songwriters was reluctant to comment on the meaning of his own work and rightly so if there was another simpler way to communicate what he wanted to say then he wouldn t have had to spend years crafting the song and wouldn t have had to wait decades for his creation to find its audience And yet without meaning any disrespect I would like to make some observations on various pieces of the song how they work together and how they form a whole greater than the sum of the parts a whole with some particular meaning for those who care to listen more deeply I ve tried to assemble a sort of canonical version of the lyrics below including all of the verses sung by Cohen in his studio and live recordings and included in the most popular cover versions If the lyrics in places seem to deviate from oft heard versions it s because in cases of conflict I ve used the words sung by Cohen himself on the Live in London disc recorded in 2009 Let s start however by considering the music The first thing to note is that the music is rather simple and straightforward which is perhaps one reason why so many people have performed it and why so many people have listened to it There is nothing tricky or alternative or difficult about the music The verses have a sort of lilting almost sing song rhythm to them a device that is easy to emulate and difficult to break that music has a sort of life of its own that carries the song along no matter who is singing it Looking at the chorus once again we are struck by the utter simplicity of it just the repetition of that one word Hallelujah to music that is somber reverent seeming to ask a question and then receiving and accepting an answer Cohen packs so much human yearning and resolution into the repetition of this one word But also through the repetition of this one word to form the chorus and then the repetition of the chorus at the end of every verse Cohen manages to convey a sort of steadfast endurance a sense that we humans over the course of our ever rising and falling fortunes always return to this one word these four syllables that give thanks for some kind of wholeness that we manage to forge out of all we experience Now let s turn to the verses The words present one side of a dialogue between the singer and some other figure in his life perhaps a former lover The dialogue is a dispute of sorts arguing in some sense over the meaning of this very word Hallelujah and their respective rights to use it And note that the structure of each verse is the same each starting with words that seem to dismiss and demean any sense of the holy but then returning in the final lines to discover and reveal an enhanced awareness of meaning in their lives rising each time to conclude in this proclamation of Hallelujah > Now I ve heard there was a secret chord > That David played and it pleased the Lord > But you don t really care for music do you > It goes like this > The fourth the fifth > The minor fall the major lift > The baffled king composing Hallelujah The singer songwriter starts out by citing a religious source pointing out that even in the Christian Bible David played a secret chord that pleased the Lord but then recalling that the person he is arguing with doesn t really care much for music But then Cohen proceeds anyway explaining how his song works with the minor fall followed by the major lift and then coming back to a Biblical image of the baffled king composing Hallelujah So what is Cohen arguing for here Some sense of mystery certainly citing the secret chord and the baffled king perhaps in contrast to a more rigid and strict interpretation of when it is appropriate to use this frankly religious term And he also seems to be suggesting that perhaps even a contemporary artist such as himself might hope to emulate David and please the Lord through his music > Your faith was strong but you needed proof > You saw her bathing on the roof > Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you > She tied you > To a kitchen chair > She broke your throne and she cut your hair > And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah Cohen then proceeds to tell a story with obvious references to Samson and Delilah from the Bible and in this telling Samson is overthrown by Delilah s beauty when he observes her bathing in the moonlight and yet he utters this word Hallelujah even after losing his power and position and dignity And so now we have Cohen holding up a very worldly beauty and defending our right to use this holy word in gratitude when in its presence > You say I took the name in vain > I don t even know the name > But if I did well really what s it to you > There s a blaze of light > In every word > It doesn t matter which you heard > The holy or the broken Hallelujah Again Cohen s lover seems to argue that such holy language be reserved for usage in a formal religious context but Cohen responds as a contemporary artist living in the material world as it is and yet arguing that there s a blaze of light in every word whether this word Hallelujah is used in praise of some divine order or whether it is used in praise of some other mysterious order that can still be discerned even in this broken world we seem to inhabit > Now maybe there s a God above > As for me all I ve ever learned from love > Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew ya > But it s not a cry that you hear at night > It s not some pilgrim who claims to have seen the light > It s a cold and it s a broken Hallelujah Here Cohen admits that perhaps there is some God above but then quickly proceeds to return our contemplation of love to a more worldly plane But then he mixes this sense of love this expression of Hallelujah into this worldly pot of love insisting that this feeling of reverence and gratitude is not associated with someone seeking divine revelation but is found with someone suffering from loss of love in this cold and broken world Cohen s message if we can call it that now seems to be clearer he s not impressed with some learned sense of piety associated with an organized religion but wants to share instead some earned sense of wholeness that comes not out of denial of the mortal world but out of a full experience and acceptance of all its pieces In fact Cohen once said that this song came from a desire to affirm my faith in life not in some formal religious way but with enthusiasm with emotion At another time he said This world is full of conflicts and full of things that cannot be reconciled But there are moments when we can reconcile and embrace the whole mess and that s what I mean by Hallelujah > Baby I ve been here before > I know this room and I ve walked this floor > You see I used to live alone before I knew ya > And I ve seen your flag on the marble arch > But love is not some kind of victory march > No it s a cold and it s a very lonely Hallelujah Cohen now tells this other figure that he knows what she is experiencing perhaps after losing a love and experiencing a sense of abandonment But he then goes on to argue that love is not merely a matter of public conquests something we feel when romantically involved with a mate but something that wells out of us even when feeling cold and alone > There was a time when you let me know > What s really going on below > But now you never show it to me do ya > I remember when I moved in you > And the holy dove was moving too > And every breath we drew was Hallelujah Again Cohen reminds this other figure that we find solace not in suppressing our emotions but in fully feeling them and sharing them And he reminds her of the sacred feelings they once felt in the physical act of love > I did my best it wasn t much > I couldn t feel so I learned to touch > I ve told the truth I didn t come to fool you > And even though > It all went wrong > I ll stand before the Lord of Song > With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah Now in this final verse Cohen begins by dismissing his efforts to love this other person not romanticizing them but simply presenting them for what they are But then even with this admission of defeat and failure he makes his final and clearest claim to use of this word he has been repeating standing not before some traditional religious God but before his own ultimate master the Lord of Song with no other word on his lips than Hallelujah What a majestic work Cohen has left us Its words and music are so plain so commonplace and yet it is almost impossible for us to hear them without being lifted up without feeling in the presence of some sort of mystery that we can never fully comprehend and yet that is constantly going on around us If so many of us sing this song Hallelujah or pause to listen to it no matter how many times we have heard it before then perhaps it is because Cohen s work reclaims for all of us our right to use this word to express this benediction to feel this sense of gratitude this sense of wholeness and acceptance no matter what our religious beliefs no matter what our position in this world no matter what loss we suffered yesterday or may suffer tomorrow In dual consideration of Cohen s achievement as well as of his recent demise I am reminded of these words from G K Chesterton gkc First > This is the great fall the fall by which the fish forgets the sea the ox forgets the meadow the clerk forgets the city every man forgets his environment and in the fullest and most literal sense forgets himself This is the real fall of Adam and it is a spiritual fall It is a strange thing that many truly spiritual men such as General Gordon have actually spent some hours in speculating upon the precise location of the Garden of Eden Most probably we are in Eden still It is only our eyes that have changed And then > The center of every man s existence is a dream Death disease insanity are merely material accidents like a toothache or a twisted ankle That these brutal forces always besiege and often capture the citadel does not prove that they are the citadel Like every great artist Cohen has changed the way in which we view the world has restored sight to our blinded eyes He was well aware in his final months that his body was failing him that his life would soon end And yet I hope that in those last days and moments he took some comfort in knowing that not only had he bestowed such a great gift upon the world but that the Lord of Song had looked down upon his work and was happy to hear it being sung on so

        content: "I ve spent some time lately working my way through The Dawn of Everything A New History of Humanity by Davids Graeber and Wengrow It s a fascinating book and a really rewarding read but it s also a serious tome clocking in at over 500 pages of text dense with facts and ideas so it s not something I ve been attempting all at one go Anyway as I was reading the latest chapter last night I came across this surprising observation > There is an obvious objection to evolutionary models which assume that our strongest social ties are based on close biological kinship many humans just don t like their families very much And this appears to be just as true of present day hunter gatherers as anybody else Many seem to find the prospect of living their entire lives surrounded by close relatives so unpleasant that they will travel very long distances just to get away from them Now in the context of the case they are making this is a critical observation the implication is that even in very early human societies there was a strong impulse for people to seek rewarding associations outside of their close family circles Before the birth of cities this might mean that people had to travel hundreds of miles on foot in order to meet new and interesting people but one of the many advantages realized with the formation of cities was that the same ends could be achieved just by traveling one or two neighborhoods over And so cities were not just formed to achieve narrow economic ends but also for social purposes But I laughed out loud when I read this passage and immediately turned to my wife to read it to her As it happens about two years ago my wife and I had left a family reunion to drive an hour and a half to hear Paul Thorn play at a small venue in Seattle This was one of the songs he performed > My family reunion is going on today > My relatives have all flown in > From places far away > As we sit there eatin chicken > It hits me like a truck > I don t like half the folks I love > > My and my former best friend > Had a big fallin out > I caught him with my wife > So I punched him in the mouth > We just can t hang out anymore > But I still wish them luck > I don t like half the folks I love > > God knows they re all dear to me > But if the truth be told > I like it when they come > But I love it when they go > I m sure they ve got good qualities > But the bad ones cover them up > I don t like half the folks I love > > My alcoholic buddies are fun to hang around > When we drink together peace and joy abound > But sometimes they bring me one more shot > When they know I ve had enough > I don t like half the folks I love > > God knows they re all dear to me > But if the truth be told > I like it when they come > But I love it when they go > I m sure they ve got good qualities > But the bad ones cover them up > I don t like half the folks I love > > In this world we live in > This I guarantee > We all need more tolerance > To get along peacefully > But I m not as nice as Jesus > And I really am fed up > I don t like half the folks I love Now I ll happily continue reading The Dawn of Everything and am sure I ll get more out of it but this morning I can t help but marvel that I had to get to page 279 of that thick book in order to come across a truth that Paul Thorn had revealed to me in four and a half minutes with meter and rhyme melody thrown in as part of the bargain The Lexicon of Song indeed"

        content: "This has always been my favorite Lyle Lovett recording The singer starts with the chorus which is then repeated after each verse Both musically and lyrically it starts out as a simple children s song with gentle bright finger picking on the guitar > If I had a boat I d go out on the ocean And if I had a pony I d ride him on my boat And we could all together go out on the ocean Me upon my pony on my boat The chorus is clearly from the perspective of a young child Each line is simple and short the rhyming consisting only of the repeated use of the word boat Note that Lovett s singing is straightforward sincere and heartfelt With the first verse though Lovett shifts gears taking a slightly older more ironic perspective > If I were Roy Rogers I d sure enough be single I couldn t bring myself to marrying old Dale It d just be me and Trigger We d go riding through them movies Then we d buy a boat and on the sea we d sail Now the singer is not just talking about horses and boats themselves but about how those things are reflected in our culture The observation that stands out is the comment about Dale Roy Rogers wife which is so far the longest line in the song putting a point of emphasis on this unexpected observation The following verse ventures further into Western culture and edges closer towards adulthood > The mystery masked man was smart He got himself a Tonto Cause Tonto did the dirty work for free But Tonto he was smarter And one day said Kemo Sabe Kiss my ass I bought a boat I m going out to sea Note that the tone is now miles away from where we started no longer that of a child s nursery rhyme The verse ends with the imagined scene of Tonto the Lone Ranger s faithful Indian companion turning on his supposed master rejecting his subordinate relationship with him and instead saying even he is headed out to sea By now it should be clear that the song is about freeing oneself from entangling binding human relationships of all kinds And so what started as a simple fanciful image from childhood has evolved into a reflection of hundreds of years of men s lives and stories of going out to sea and riding off into sunsets and pursuing dangerous work that makes it difficult or impossible or risky to pursue normal familial bliss And so while this is a simple song that lasts barely more than three minutes it resonates with whole canons from the likes of Howard Hawks and Raymond Chandler One more verse remains > And if I were like lightning I wouldn t need no sneakers I d come and go wherever I would please And I d scare em by the shade tree And I d scare em by the light pole But I would not scare my pony on my boat out on the sea Here the singer imagines himself as a wraith like figure no longer able to relate to other humans except by frightening them As the song s conclusion this feels like an admission from Lovett that the sort of disentanglement from human affairs described in the song is a dead end into which the protagonist can only disappear And so in the context of the album Pontiac as its opening track the song seems to briefly consider the possibility of withdrawing from romantic relationships altogether then ends by rejecting the notion as a bad idea a perfect introduction to the rest of the album which then dives back into the complex world of adult relationships in all their wildly entertaining glory By the way the song is also featured prominently both in its original version performed by Lyle Lovett and as a cover sung by Karen Elson in the 2014 film Still Alice sa In the context of that film the song works as an aural analogue to the action on screen where the main character Alice Howland is suffering the slow mental deterioration that accompanies Alzheimer s disease And so the song becomes a playful gentle way to think about the gradual withdrawal from normal human relationships that Alice is undergoing in the film See also this analysis of the song from The Middle Spaces ms blog iihab http www amazon com gp product B00BKJ7W4C ref=as li tl ie=UTF8 camp=1789 creative=390957 creativeASIN=B00BKJ7W4C linkCode=as2 tag=reasontorock 20 linkId=MDQSILUN7YZLFJYU ll http www amazon com Lyle Lovett e B000AQ3CJ0 encoding=UTF8 camp=1789 creative=390957 linkCode=ur2 tag=reasontorock 20 linkId=2UD7XVECMUWFB735 ms https themiddlespaces wordpress com 2013 05 06 me up on my pony on my boat pontiac http www amazon com gp product B000002PG7 ref=as li tl ie=UTF8 camp=1789 creative=390957 creativeASIN=B000002PG7 linkCode=as2 tag=reasontorock 20 linkId=PYLOPIHT5O2OR4NQ sa http en wikipedia org wiki Still Alice"

lord oh oh > Oh no lord no no oh The lyrics by themselves are interesting but far from great poetry Most of their appeal is on the surface without much subtlety and with few poetic devices employed The song is fairly short There are only two verses and they present a clear contrast The first verse talks about the past and the errors of the singer s ways drug use pride egotism and a focus on the artist as an independent individual The last lines of the first verse hint at the transformation to come The second verse talks about the present and future describing a different set of characteristics humility self awareness childlike simplicity and a sense of being part of a greater whole Following the second verse there is another section of the song containing injunctions for the listener to join in with the singer to create a better world Structurally in terms of words and music this is an interesting variation from the normal pop song form since it is neither verse chorus nor bridge The variation works well since the song breaks out of past conventions just as the singer enjoins the listener to do the same there is a palpable sense of liberation of breaking free from old patterns The music of the track greatly reinforces and extends the meaning of the words so let s turn to that now The song is built around a simple riff Like all great rock riffs it is all about expansion and contraction ascension and descent acceleration and restraint the foundation for the Rolling Stones song Satisfaction is another interesting example The music immediately adds tension that was missing from the lyrics alone The hard driving bass the fast tempo the drum kit and the additional drums let s call them congas create a rhythmic mix sounding like something about to explode On the third repetition of the riff another instrument is layered on top echoing the underlying melody and sounding like something trying to break free from the undertow Then the first verse starts Co composer Dennis Wilson takes the lead vocal Deviating from the normal pretty Beach Boys sound the delivery is spoken as much as sung his voice expressing the pressure felt in the music Emotional color is favored over melodic delivery as when he reaches for two high notes with the words sky high Background harmonies begin immediately and run parallel to the lead vocal heightening the sense of tension The pace slows and the background music fades as Dennis hits the chorus This produces two desirable effects First it provides a sort of caesura temporarily relieving the tension providing some needed pacing to prevent the song from either peaking too soon or becoming relentless Second it illustrates the sense of the words As Dennis sings I m singing in my heart the music pauses as if to let us hear this quiet voice Even here the group avoids sounding merely pretty The words and melody are lovely but the congas continue in the background not letting the pressure escape entirely and Dennis vocals are echoed by an electronic instrument that sounds vaguely like a honking goose So while singing from your heart may be authentic and gratifying it is not necessarily pretty The second verse chorus combination follow the same musical pattern as the first providing a pleasant sense of familiarity as the words of the second verse unfold with their tale of redemption Now as the second chorus ends the drums build to a new level of frenzy but instead of the anticipated explosion the song is suddenly transformed into a quiet call and response gospel number Suddenly there is nothing but a slow commanding bass line with faint vocals overhead Once again but to an even greater extent now the pace of the song is slowed the pressure reduced the climax delayed As this section of the song unfolds vocals and instruments are gradually added slowly building back up to the previous level of intensity Again as with the chorus the device serves dual purposes In addition to the needed pacing the relative quiet of the music serves to frame the key lyrics as they are delivered It s about time we get together To be out front and love one another Brothers sisters everybody We better start to help each other now The music continues to build ascending to the same level of tension achieved at the end of the second chorus The drums again accelerate foreshadowing some sort of decisive resolution to the conflict Then the final words are delivered providing thematic resolution When we re sharing our love brother That s when we know we can shape another world An electric guitar enters the fray soaring above the rhythmic stew providing the much delayed release beautifully symbolizing this promise of another world Then the guitar descends echoing the bass riff pushing and pulling the rhythm while the singer does the same using the word Lord repeatedly more as a sound than a unit of meaning The song continues in this fashion gradually fading a reminder that we are not there yet that this new world is a guiding vision but not yet a reality as we return to the tension of our current lives This recording is a beautiful incarnation of the rock aesthetic It is a true collaborative work with multiple songwriters and musicians working together seamlessly and with little input from Brian Wilson the often alleged genius of the group The words are meaningful and expressive but clearly rely on rock instrumentation and vocals to achieve their impact The recording is wonderful with every note instrument and sound contributing to the overall unified effect A sense of liberation of release from constraints is expressed by both words and music The basic 4 4 rock beat serves as a sturdy foundation for the overlaid rhythmic complexity delivered by multiple drums instruments and vocals Electric instruments are used to provide a unique sound to the piece with the detailed sounds of the notes mattering more than the symbolic values recorded by musical notation And the whole recording achieves an artistic effect that far transcends traditional elements of a song Originally published at ReasonToRock com https www reasontorock com tracks its about

Corn in the fields > Listen to the rice when the wind blows cross the water > King Harvest has surely come The lyrics of the song work on many levels At one level as Robertson says in the liner notes to the remastered CD of The Band it is a song about the labor unions the quiet revolution when people went from being separated to something making them feel that they were all part of something in their livelihood Bowman 2000b At this level the words reflect one of The Band s central themes that of liberation from personal identity into a broader consciousness The lyrics work at another level though Let s focus for a moment on what might be called the chorus the three lines that begin and end the song and with some variation separate the verses There are some unusual elements here As Rob Bowman notes in the liner notes for the To Kingdom Come compilation the chorus is quieter than the verse which is atypical Bowman 1989 Also the song begins with these lines even though a chorus usually does not appear until after the first verse We see as well that the words to the chorus are not repeated exactly with the exception of the final line which is also the title of the song King Harvest has surely come Neither do these lines summarize or conclude the action of the verses as is the norm for a chorus Finally we note that these lines have no fixed rhyming structure which is very unusual for a popular song Instead each of these three line stanzas is almost a haiku even down to the traditional observation of nature and the seasons which is characteristic of this Japanese poetic form Given all of these variations from a normal chorus form it may be better to view these lines as something else altogether To me they seem to form another song that is combined with the central one To use terms from William Blake s poetry it is as if we have a Song of Innocence intertwined with a Song of Experience The haiku like stanzas present the innocent perspective focusing on simple sensual experiences of nature the sound of the wind the smell of the magnolia leaves the vision of a yellow moon And then the reference to King Harvest a seemingly mythical symbol of the power of nature All of these images work at a very simple primitive level of consciousness referring to timeless aspects of the natural world This effect is reinforced by the music These three lines begin with simple unadorned hushed vocals emphasizing the simplicity and naturalness of the images When Levon Helm sings Listen to the rice when the wind blows cross the water we are waiting expecting to hear something Then Levon Helm responds with a quiet repeated slightly rising tapping of his cymbal mixed with Garth Hudson s slowly emerging swirling organ The sounds and rhythms are natural ones like the wind blowing through the trees or cicadas on a summer evening Listen to the difference though when the band makes the transition to the verse Nothing is simple or natural The drums hold everything together but the guitar organ and vocals all seem to be fighting each other straining under some heavy load One organ line stops and starts playing off the beat keeping the listener off balance Robertson s guitar crackles while Manuel is singing and also between his lines competing for attention Richard hesitates in his delivery of the vocals again as if under some stress lagging a bit behind the beat Another organ line quietly builds in the background during the first half of the verse with long sustained chords in defiance of everything else going on The musical message is clear undercutting the hopeful optimism of the words in the first verse there are powerful conflicts at work This underlying tension apparent only in the music of the first verse emerges into the level of the lyrics on the second verse Drought threatens the singer s crops and he ends up living on skid row The third verse completes the drama leading up to the singer s enlistment in the union with his barn burning and the loss of his horse By this time Helm is no longer just keeping the beat but raining sharp blows against his drums in increasing intensity The stark contrast between the two perspectives is complete In clear opposition to the simple natural beauty depicted in the chorus like refrains we have the imperfection conflict and defeat of actual life The tension between the two is unresolved and irreconcilable Manuel s vocal disappears from the last verse and Robertson s guitar takes center stage His quiet instrument alternates between lyric beauty and stinging sharp rhythmic attacks perfectly representing the push and pull of the two states the continuing tension between them Robertson s solo here is a perfect example of the type of playing he describes in talking with Rob Bowman > This was the new way of dealing with the guitar for me this very > subtle playing leaving out a lot of stuff and just waiting until the > last second and then playing the thing in just the nick of time It > was an approach to playing where it s so delicate It s the opposite > of the in your face guitar playing that I used to do This was the > kind of thing that was slippery It was like you have to hold your > breath while playing these kinds of solos You can t breathe or you ll > throw yourself off Bowman 1989 This recording is a tremendous work of art When The Band s recordings were first released they astonished the rock world with the strength of their ensemble playing While many bands were experimenting with jazz like solos and improvisation The Band reminded everyone of the true rock aesthetic with compact recordings formed by a balanced interlacing of instruments each member playing a part in the overall composition but no one player out in front The result as in this case was high art dense and rich with every sonic brush stroke playing a deliberate part in the overall effect Originally published at ReasonToRock com https www

        content: "This song has been on my mind a lot lately so I decided to research and write about it It s certainly an outlier in the Neil Young songbook It closed out Young s first self titled solo album with a running time of close to ten minutes This was an album my friends and I pretty much wore out in our dorm rooms listening to it when it first came out so I ve been familiar with it for a long time A live recording of the song was released in 2008 as part of the Sugar Mountain Live at Canterbury House 1968 album and I actually prefer this version For one it includes a couple of lines that add to the song that were missing from the earlier studio recording for another Young s vocals seem purer and less strained in the intimate coffee house setting In both recordings it s just Young singing over the strumming of his guitar and the only production effect you re missing with the live version is some ill considered echo which seems to be there on the studio version just so that producer Jack Nitzsche could say he had something to do with the track In some ways we might easily dismiss this song as not really meriting much consideration It was certainly not a hit it didn t become any sort of staple in Young s live shows and it s probably a song that many people have never even listened to in its entirety it still clocks in at over eight minutes in the Canterbury House set And since the music is clearly just a rough vehicle for the lyrics it can easily fall into the tl dr category even for those who might have been exposed to it at some point It s also sometimes described as a song that s somewhat mysterious with no fathomable meaning as in this page on Song facts https www songfacts com facts neil young last trip to tulsa Let s see what we can make of it Note that each of the first four verses starts with Well I used to a device that prepares us for a change of perspective and signals that Young may be in some ways talking about his own past Also note that Young uses surrealistic imagery throughout the song and it s clear that much of what he describes cannot be taken literally He starts out as a cab driver perhaps in Los Angeles > Well I used to drive a cab you know > I heard a siren scream > Pulled over to the corner and I fell into a dream > There were two men eating pennies > And three young girls who cried > The West coast is falling I see rocks in the sky > The preacher took his Bible and laid it on the stool > He said With the congregation running > Why should I play the fool The phrase I fell into a dream seems to point to the surrealistic aspect of the narrative in a way that is reminiscent of the way the phrase I went into a dream is used in A Day in the Life by The Beatles With men eating pennies and young girls crying and the the West coast falling and rocks in the sky it is no wonder that the congregation is running and even the preacher is ready to pull up stakes So while there s no explicit rational explanation for the words this first verse clearly does a couple of things + Suggests a sense of impermanence and a lack of integrity + Associates these feelings with the West coast of the US Since Young s previous band had been based in L A it s probably not much of a stretch to more specifically tie these feelings to Southern California an impression confirmed as we move further through the song In the next verse Young takes the part of a woman > Well I used to be a woman you know > I took you for a ride > I let you fly my airplane > It looked good for your pride > Cause you re the kind of man you know > Who likes what he says > I wonder what s it s like to be so far over my head > Well the lady made the wedding > And she brought along the ring > She got down on her knees and said > Let s get on with this thing Again Young is depicting a scene in which the actors are pretending are deceiving each other in order to get what they want Just as the preacher was ready to jump ship at the first sign of danger in the first verse the woman in this verse is willing to make the man feel important and powerful in order to achieve her goal of becoming his wife Again not much integrity or authenticity to be found The next verse is probably closer to home for Young reflecting some of his own experiences playing on street corners before forming The Buffalo Springfield > Well I used to be a folk singer > Keeping managers alive > When you saw me on a corner > And told me I was jive > So I unlocked your mind you know > To see what I could see > If you guarantee the postage > I ll mail you back the key > Well I woke up in the morning > With an arrow through my nose > There was an Indian in the corner > Trying on my clothes Again we have stories of people using each other in order to gain their own ends and again displaying a lack of authenticity The last three lines are probably a reference to Young s song Broken Arrow as well to the fringed jackets that Young was often seen wearing when he was part of the Springfield The next verse has Young playing dead but then turning out to still be alive > Well I used to be asleep you know > With blankets on my bed > I stayed there for a while > Till they discovered I was dead > The coroner was friendly and > I liked him quite a lot > If I hadn t have been a woman > I guess I d never have been caught > They called up all my friends and > Told them they had been misled > They gave me back my house and car > And nothing more was said The lines beginning They called up all my friends are the ones missing from the original studio recording and their insertion into the song seems to supply a transition that was missing before This verse reminds me of Mark Twain s alleged line that The reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated It certainly could be some sort of oblique reference to the way Young was treated after the breakup of Buffalo Springfield either by the press or by some of his fellow musicians But again it s a story of people fooling each other for ulterior motives and more than a suggestion of missing authenticity And now finally in the fifth verse we come across the song s title > Well I was driving down the freeway > When my car ran out of gas > Pulled over to the station > But I was afraid to ask > The servicemen were yellow > And the gasoline was green > Although I knew I could not > I thought that I was gonna scream > That was on my last trip to Tulsa > Just before the snow > If you ever need a ride there > Be sure to let me know So what does Tulsa represent in this song This Oklahoma city was the starting point for a number of musicians and can be thought of someplace more down home and authentic than the West coast of California See the song Tulsa Time for a more explicit example of this sort of usage The mention of snow also brings up images of Young s youth growing up in Canada And now finally let s consider the final verse > I was chopping down a palm tree > When a friend dropped by to ask > If I would feel less lonely > If he helped me swing the axe > I said No it s not a case > Of being lonely we have here > I ve been working on this palm tree > For eighty seven years > He said Go get lost and > Walked toward his Cadillac > I chopped down the palm tree > And it landed on his back Palm trees are some of the most ubiquitous symbols of Southern California so the act of chopping one down is certainly a way of targeting the L A scene The friend with the Cadillac offering to help in order to make the singer feel less lonely can easily be seen as a fellow musician or someone from the industry who is seeking some kind of partnership or union for some ulterior motive rather than from any authentic shared sense of mission The statement that Young has been working on the palm tree for eighty seven years can be seen in a couple of ways in contrast with the other action in this tale it can be taken as a sign of permanence and authenticity and sincere mission and then considering the body of work that Young has produced in the years since it can be seen as a fairly prescient forecast of Young s own focused dedication to his art When the supposed friend tells the singer to Go get lost it can be seen as one final admission of inauthenticity the fellow turns out to not be very supportive of Young or his efforts after all The closing bit of action with the palm tree falling on to the friend s back ends the song with a nice piece of irony but is probably a little nastier than Young might have wished This might be why along with his partnership with Crosby Stills Nash that was unfolding about the same time Young in a repeat visit to the Canterbury House in 1969 reportedly refused a request to play the song https digital bentley umich edu midaily mdp 39015071754159 466 saying that he no longer liked it and was sorry he had recorded it A later live recording of the song has surfaced though performed with the Stray Gators so any regrets about the song appear to have been transient The late sixties saw a remarkable turn of events in the music industry A number of young singers who had been viewed as disposable products flashes in the pan that would soon be replaced by a fresh crop of young faces turned out instead to be the genuine articles singer songwriters who were not in it primarily for the money but who were dedicated artists in it for the long haul This song planted a stake in the ground marking a turning point in Neil Young s career but one that was mirrored by other singer songwriters of his generation The song seems as relevant today as it was in 1969 with Spotify being the latest entity telling Young to Go get lost https www nytimes com 2022 02 01 arts music spotify rogan neil young html while Young continues to ply his chops elsewhere The players and platforms and technologies change but the art endures Which after all seems the message of Neil s song"

        content: "Unlike most other posts in the Lexicon of Song this one covers an entire album and not just a single song I count this 1974 album from Jackson Browne as one of the greatest artistic achievements in the history of rock music If your evaluation is just based on the album s sales or on the number of hit singles it generated or even on the average quality of the individual tracks then you could easily place it at a mere 375 on a list of the greatest albums of all time as did the editors of Rolling Stone magazine in their most recent update to a list they refer to as definitive But the album is so much more than any of these individual attributes What Browne accomplished on Late For the Sky was to deliver an extended meditation on the cycle of enchantment and disillusionment that is arguably at the center of our human existence and his examination of this subject ranged from the intensely personal to the broadly cultural When viewed within this overarching concept each component of the album takes on heightened meaning as each piece adds to and is also enhanced by the integrity of the whole In order to explain what I mean here I d like permission to take you on an in depth journey through the album I think I can promise that your understanding of the work will be enhanced by the time spent but I can also say with some confidence that your understanding of the full potential of rock music and perhaps even your understanding of the human condition will also be expanded by the journey Contents toc Can I Get A Witness As it happens I m not the only one who holds this album in such high regard Here are the words delivered by Bruce Springsteen on the occasion of Jackson Browne s induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004 hof > In seventies post Vietnam America there was no album that captured the fall from Eden the long slow afterburn of the sixties its heartbreak its disappointments its spent possibilities better than Jackson s masterpiece <cite>Late for the Sky< cite> > > It s just a beautiful body of work It s essential in making sense of the times Before the Deluge still gives me goose bumps and it raises me to cause Late for the Sky when those car doors slam at the end of the record they still bring tears to my eye And there was no more searching yearning loving music made for and about America at the time > > In this and so much of Jackson s writing you see the slow meticulous crafting of the songs the thoughtfulness Jackson was one of the first songwriters I d met who demonstrated the value of thinking hard about what you were saying your subject And here are some thoughts from Stephen Holden who penned the original Rolling Stone album review rsreview > Like Browne s two previous albums Late for the Sky contains no lyric sheet The three or four hours required to make a full transcription will however be well worth the effort for anyone interested in discovering lyric genius I can t think of another writer who merges with such natural grace and fluidity his private and public personas in a voice that is morally compelling yet noncoercive Hopefully these testimonials will be enough to convince you to join me

Album Cover Let s first pause lovingly as the listener should with a look at the album cover cover An iTunes graphic or even a CD cover barely does it justice The inspiration for the visual comes from the painting L Empire des Lumi 232 res ledl by Belgian painter Ren 233 Magritte magritte The cover art was created by photographer Bob Seidemann seidemann after Browne showed him a poster of the Magritte painting and asked him for something similar with an old Chevy in front of a house The resulting graphic combines light and dark the intimate glow of a bedroom window with a vast expanse of endless blue sky an aging auto under a glowing streetlight a tree with leaves fringed by sunlight To some extent the cover contains props that will make their appearances within some of the album s lyrics the stolen Chevrolet from the The Road and the Sky the sky referenced in many of the album s songs To an even greater extent though these elements of the cover foreshadow the contrasts and conflicts of the album s thematic content <p><img style= max width 100 src= https reasontorock com images misc magritte seidemann jpg alt= Empire of Light next to Late for the Sky title= Empire of

15004 0012A 000 rene magritte lempire des lumieres jpg seidemann http www bobseidemann com The Album Title Let s now consider the album title Late for the Sky The phrase seems to have no possible literal sense the sky is always there so how can one be late for it so it demands a more nuanced reading The word late suggests both intention and failure one meant to make the show but did not get there in time It also suggests a strong sense of the temporal timing as they say is everything The word sky suggests something vast and unchanging existing beyond the bounds of normal human time It also suggests a form of universal human aspiration a symbol of our best intentions especially in a year when humanity had landed on the moon only five years earlier Combined the two words suggest missed opportunities a gap between aspirations and reality the difference between limited human abilities and limitless dreams and aspirations And so in a mere four words Browne has outlined the overall sweep of the album Musical Approach Browne works with a sympathetic set of vocalists and instrumentalists here and makes full use of their talents The extraordinary David Lindley lindley plays violin and guitar and as usual always seems to perfectly complement Browne s vocals The general musical approach is slow and thoughtful with Browne s music leaving lots of space for other vocalists and musicians and allowing the listener time for appreciation of each word and phrase With only eight tracks on the album and an average track length of five to six minutes Browne is here venturing beyond the typical formats for both Top 40 recording artists and folk singers The musical accompaniment is rich and finely etched carefully crafted to support and extend each of the songs in unique ways lindley https www davidlindley com index html Thematic Overview As we go through the details of the album what we will gradually see revealed is an examination of the human cycle of innocence experience illusion disillusionment enchantment disenchantment birth death creation dissolution More distinctly Browne looks at the cycle of attaching meaning to the people places and events of one s life and then seeing that meaning fade and disappear And while much of Browne s earlier work spoke to very personal experiences at specific points within this cycle and from the interior of this wheel here Browne expands his scope looking not only at very concrete individual experiences along the way but at the cycle as a whole In doing so he manages to evoke not just a personal sense of the journeys of a handful of specific characters he s painted for us but the mood of an entire generation at that particular point in time a generation on its own journey from innocence to experience painfully trying to transform its own fading illusions into some new sense of meaning And finally Browne talks about nothing less than how this birth death cycle might apply to the human race as a whole Track 1 Late for the Sky The title track starts the album with a very personal picture capturing a romantic pair just at the very moment of disenchantment and disillusionment As we watch and listen Browne painfully scrapes away the patina of illusion and gradually reveals the lonely reality lying beneath The words here tie back to the cover art Browne could be singing to us from the upstairs bedroom depicted there and when he talks about tracing the lovers steps until they vanished into the air that infinite blue sky of the cover shows where those steps end But Browne s intent here and the song s effect is more than just portraiture he s asking open ended questions that have no clear answers and that can by extension be applied to all human relationships Did these two once love each other Were they ever really together If so what happened to the love they once felt Where did it go At what point was the love lost How could they go from such intimate feelings of togetherness to feelings of being so profoundly alone And is one state more real than the other Is the state of enchantment illusory or is it the most profound reality that humans can know even if it transitory > The words had all been spoken > And somehow the feeling still wasn t right > And still we continued on through the night > Tracing our steps from the beginning > Until they vanished into the air > Trying to understand how our lives had led us there > > Looking hard into your eyes > There was nobody I d ever known > Such an empty surprise to feel so alone > > Now for me some words come easy > But I know that they don t mean that much > Compared with the things that are said when lovers touch > You never knew what I loved in you > I don t know what you loved in me > Maybe the picture of somebody you were hoping I might be > > Awake again I can t pretend and I know I m alone > And close to the end of the feeling we ve known > > How long have I been sleeping > How long have I been drifting alone through the night > How long have I been dreaming I could make it right > If I closed my eyes and tried with all my might > To be the one you need > > Awake again I can t pretend and I know I m alone > And close to the end of the feeling we ve known > > How long have I been sleeping > How long have I been drifting alone through the night > How long have I been running for that morning flight > Through the whispered promises and the changing light > Of the bed where we both lie > Late for the sky One of the things worth noting is the song s structure This is not a typical verse chorus pop song Browne bends the arc of the song to reflect his meaning The first two verses talking about words are slow and reflective But when Browne asks How long have I been sleeping the music shifts starting to surge and rise questing seeking some release or resolution Also worthy of mention is David Lindley s beautiful delicate guitar work throughout the song When Browne sings about the meaning of words compared to a lover s touch Lindley s tender caressing of his strings seems to represent that physical dimension missing from Browne s narrative Although pop songs of all kinds have talked about relationships both successful and failed most describe the highs and the lows few if any have chosen to so honestly focus on this moment of crumbling to so nakedly portray the lovers still in each other s physical presence but with the illusions about each other having been stripped away Browne is neither romanticizing nor demonizing nor mourning his lover but instead is painfully showing what s left when those emotional overlays are removed Part of Browne s achievement here lies in his avoidance of the histrionics that usually accompany failing relationships There is no self pity no condemnation no harsh words slamming doors or fights The song as well as the story it tells betray an absence of any of these mechanisms we usually use to distance ourselves from the emptiness at the core of these situations By avoiding these Browne accomplishes the difficult task of bringing us right to the heart of the loss he feels and lets us feel it with him rather than simply telling us about it By avoiding use of these other dramatic elements Browne is also able to focus much more clearly on the heart of the matter the loss of meaning that the two once attached to each other and their relationship In fact the primary scene painted by the song is one of people going through the motions of a relationship yet bereft of any of the usual meaning associated with such actions This opening scene clearly sets the stage for the issues of enchantment and disenchantment that will be explored throughout the rest of the album Track 2 Fountain of Sorrow After starting by taking us with him to a very specific point in the arc of a failing relationship Browne now looks back on this or another relationship from a greater philosophical distance alternately contrasting earlier feelings with later apprehensions Let s see how he starts > Looking through some photographs > I found inside a drawer > I was taken by a photograph of you > There were one or two I know that > You would have liked a little more > But they didn t show your spirit quite as true > > You were turning round to see who was behind you > And I took your childish laughter by surprise > And at the moment that my camera happened to find you > There was just a trace of sorrow in your eyes We start with a drawer full of old photos flat images capturing moments from the past But then instead of the photographer taking the pictures he is taken by one of his photos one that is more than just a two dimensional image but captures some inner spirit of its subject the person being addressed by the singer And although the photo takes the subject by surprise with childish laughter coming from her mouth there is also a wisp of sadness in her eyes Note already all the opposing tensions introduced in this so far very simple story of photos being taken appearance vs substance observer vs observed artifice vs reality forward vs backwards past vs present innocence vs experience childhood vs adulthood joy vs sorrow > Now the things that I remember > Seem so distant and so small > Though it hasn t really > Been that long a time > What I was seeing wasn t > What was happening at all > Although for a while > Our path did seem to climb > > When you see through love s illusions > There lies the danger > And your perfect lover > Just looks like a perfect fool > So you go running off > In search of a perfect stranger > While the loneliness seems to > Spring from your life > Like a fountain from a pool Now the singer focuses more specifically on illusion vs reality He acknowledges that what he once thought he was seeing between the two of them wasn t real But then he talks about the danger of seeing through love s illusions turning a perfect lover into a perfect fool and causing the singer to chase after a perfect stranger evoking three very different sorts of perfection and perhaps suggesting that the idea of perfection is itself illusory And then he introduces the image from the song s title of a fountain of sorrow bringing a constant flow of loneliness to the surface from some deep wellspring below But now having acknowledged the existence of this fountain Browne begins to reconcile the song s contrasting opposites > Fountain of sorrow > Fountain of light > You ve known that hollow sound > Of your own steps in flight > You ve had to hide sometimes > But now you re all right > And it s good to see > Your smiling face tonight The fountain now becomes a source of light as well as sorrow and the singer s subject is now out of hiding and smiling and the singer and his subject are happily reunited Browne now delivers a clear eyed assessment of their situation > Now for you and me it may not be > That hard to reach our dreams > But that magic feeling never seems to last > And while the future s there for anyone to change > Still you know it seems > It would be easier sometimes > To change the past Here Browne steps back from any particular player in the drama or any particular act in the play and instead gives us a view of the cycle as a whole innocence experience illusion disillusionment freedom entrapment Now Browne looks at his own situation realizing he is on a path of growing awareness and wisdom > I m just one or two years and a couple of changes behind you > In my lessons at love s pain and heartache school > Where if you feel too free > And you need something to remind you > There s this loneliness > Springing up from your life > Like a fountain from a pool Now he repeats his earlier lines again joining this image of a fountain of sorrow to the present joyous connection between singer and subject > Fountain of sorrow > Fountain of light > You ve known that hollow sound > Of your own steps in flight > You ve had to hide sometimes > But now you re all right > And it s good to see > Your smiling face tonight Now the music slows almost to a stop with just piano and bass playing slowly as if bringing the song to a close But then just when we think it might be over the other musicians join in again Now we have the chorus repeated but with additional words > Fountain of sorrow > Fountain of light > You ve known that hollow sound > Oof your own steps in flight > You ve had to struggle > You ve had to fight > To keep understanding > And compassion in sight > You could be laughing at me > You ve got the right > But you go on smiling > So clear and so bright The music here is warm buoyant and radiant as Browne sings the final words of joy and reconciliation of warmth and connection and acceptance Track 3 Farther On This is a beautiful contemplative song featuring some piercingly sweet guitar work from David Lindley Browne starts by reflecting on a lonely childhood filled with fantasies > In my early years I hid my tears > And passed my days alone > Adrift on an ocean of loneliness > My dreams like nets were thrown > To catch the love that I d heard of > In books and films and songs > Now there s a world of illusion and fantasy > In the place where the real world belongs But interestingly Browne the adult is not trying to distance himself from this past but instead is seemingly embracing it as part of his current self > Still I look for the beauty in songs > To fill my head and lead me on > Though my dreams have come up torn and empty > As many times as love has come and gone Now he reflects on those with whom he shared his dreams and schemes acknowledging the impracticality of his visions > To those gentle ones my memory runs > To the laughter we shared at the meals > I filled their kitchens and living rooms > With my schemes and my broken wheels > It was never clear how far or near > The gates to my citadel lay > They were cutting from stone some dreams of their own > But they listened to mine anyway And now a rather startling admission from a highly articulate wordsmith > I m not sure what I m trying to say > It could be I ve lost my way > Though I keep a watch over the distance > Heaven s no closer than it was yesterday And now a beautifully poetic word painting in which Browne acknowledges that the angels are older and yet he is still accompanied by them rather than flesh and blood human beings > And the angels are older > They know not to wait up for the sun > They look over my shoulder > At the maps and the drawings of the journey I ve begun And now we learn that Browne despite his self knowledge gained by reflecting on his past is still pursuing a vision in the distance > Now the distance leads me farther on > Though the reasons I once had are gone > I keep thinking I ll find what I m looking for > In the sand beneath the dawn And now we conclude with Browne firmly committed to continuing the pursuit of his beautiful visions still moving farther on > But the angels are older > They can see that the sun s setting fast > They look over my shoulder > At the vision of paradise contained in the light of the past > And they lay down behind me > To sleep beside the road till the morning has come > Where they know they will find me > With my maps and my faith in the distance > Moving farther on This is a remarkable song because unlike most works contrasting youthful innocence vs age and experience this is not a story of disillusionment quite to the contrary it is a firm commitment to continuing illusion to a continued pursuit of what I would call enchantment Despite the evident tension between dreams and reality Browne here admits that he has no intention of settling for mere reality no matter how many times his dreams have come up torn and empty and no matter how much older the angels seem to be Track 4 The Late Show This song closes out the original side one of the album As such it s a bit of a place holder touching on and carrying forward several of the album s themes and symbols but deferring any strong resolutions until side two It s also a bit experimental in its construction with a recurring often overlapping vocal chorus sometimes echoing Browne s words at other times extending his thoughts And then there are those percussive door slams at the end of the track These unusual elements perhaps offer a couple of reasons why Browne has rarely performed this song in his live shows Note that the song title plays with the word late but the word and title appear nowhere within the song s lyrics Today we think of The Late Show as a late night talk show but back when this song was written before cable before Netflix the phrase might have more typically referred to the old black and white movies that aired on broadcast television channels during the hours when most people were asleep The singer starts with some general observations and reflections on the difficulty of having close relationships > Everyone I ve ever known has wished me well > Anyway that s how it seems it s hard to tell > Maybe people only ask you how you re doing > cause that s easier than letting on how little they could care > But when you know that you ve got a real friend somewhere > Suddenly all the others are so much easier to bear Now he touches on the tension between the real and the ideal the difficulty of breaking out of a lonely space and the inadequacy of words > Now to see things clear it s hard enough I know > While you re waiting for reality to show > Without dreaming of the perfect love > And holding it so far above > That if you stumbled onto someone real you d never know > you d never know > You could be with somebody who is lonely too > sometimes it doesn t show > He might be trying to get across to you > words can be so slow > When your own emptiness is all that s getting through > There comes a point when you re not sure why you re still talking > I passed that point long ago > long ago > I m so tired of all this circling > And all these glimpses of the end > you know it s useless to pretend > That s all the voices say > you ll go right on circling > Until you ve found some kind of friend But now the song turns from generalities towards an encounter with an actual flesh and blood person apparently a woman in a bar or at a party > I saw you through the laughter and the noise > You were talking with the soldiers and the boys > While they scuffled for your weary smiles > I thought of all the empty miles > And the years that I ve spent looking for your eyes > looking for your eyes > And now I m sitting here wondering what to say > that you might recognize > Afraid that all these words might scare you away > and break through the disguise > No one ever talks about their feelings anyway > Without dressing them in dreams and laughter > I guess it s just too painful otherwise And now Browne wraps things up by setting an imaginary scene both for us as listeners and for the woman he has been trying to meet a scene that sounds very close to the one pictured on the album cover > Look > It s like you re standing in the window > Of a house nobody lives in > And I m sitting in a car across the way > let s just say > It s an early model Chevrolet > let s just say > It s a warm and windy day > You go and pack your sorrow > The trash man comes tomorrow > Leave it at the curb and we ll just roll away And so we have a tidy finish to the song a Hollywood ending if you will even if admittedly and intentionally contrived Browne pulls off several neat tricks here and the song plays a definite role in the construction of the album and it s moving music being played On the other hand the song as a singular work lacks any particular thematic or narrative center and this may be another reason why it is infrequently heard in live shows and is rarely served up by streaming services Track 5 The Road and the Sky This is the song that opens the second side of the original album and it is also the central linchpin for the varied themes of the album the recording that brings together all the album s various elements and places them in relationship to one another The first thing to note is that despite the sorrow and tragedy running through the album this is an upbeat song a rocker one filled with a sense of lunatic optimism David Lindley s slide guitar elsewhere used with haunting restraint here gets amped up propelling Browne s vocals along at a breakneck pace The lyrics start with clearly symbolic intent echoing the album s title > When we come to the place > Where the road and the sky collide > Throw me over the edge > And let my spirit glide Here Browne quickly takes up the major thematic conflict of the album and just as quickly states his position unequivocally when stark realities conflict with idealistic aspirations he seems to be saying I ll take the idealistic aspirations every time The next four lines candidly reveal some of Browne s motivation for such a decision > They told me I was going to > Have to work for a living > But all I want to do is ride > I don t care where we re going from here > Honey you decide The next verse again takes up the issues of dreams vs reality > Well I spend my time at the > Bottom of a wishing well > And I can hear my dreams > Singing clear as a bell > I used to know where they ended > And the world began > But now it s getting hard to tell > I could be just around the corner from heaven > Or a mile from hell Here Browne amplifies the depth of his self knowledge referenced in the first verse freely admitting that he s not sure he can any longer tell dreams from reality or whether his pursuit of these dreams is bringing him closer to salvation or damnation And an interesting implication of his image located at the bottom of a well is that it s one of the few places one can imagine where all you can see is sky But now we finally get to the chorus and the central image of the song and perhaps of the album Seemingly indicating knowledge of his own shortcomings the pace of the song slows with Browne singing in a tone more confessional than boastful over background cowbell percussion that sounds like the stuttering engine of an aging vehicle that may fail at any moment > I m just rolling away from yesterday > Behind the wheel of a stolen Chevrolet > I m going to get a little higher > And see if I can hot wire reality Continuing the imagery that ended the first verse Browne here constructs in four lines the ultimate image of rock liberation Building on the twin legacies of Chuck Berry berry and Jack Kerouac kerouac Browne takes to the road in another automobile fleeing the past and ready for the future whatever it may bring getting a little higher closer to the sky as he goes and fully prepared to encounter reality commandeer it and incorporate it in his wild ride Now comes the final verse > Now can you see those dark clouds gathering up ahead > They re going to wash this planet clean like the Bible said > Now you can hold on steady and try to be ready > But everybody s going to get wet > Don t think it won t happen just because it hasn t happened yet Notice that Browne has here just delivered on the promise made in the chorus He starts by pointing out to his listener companion the presence of some very real dark clouds occupying the sky ahead This is presumably a chunk of reality But now he hot wires that reality he attaches meaning to it he builds a story around it he uses it for his own purpose And then he ends with words expressing the sentiment of any true visionary any storyteller Don t think it won t happen just because it hasn t happened yet One could certainly question whether this song is really the thematic center of the album since it seems to contradict or at least reduce in significance the dirgeful disillusionment expressed in much of the rest of the album s content But I view the song this way for several reasons Its placement at the center of the album at its core so to speak Its references to the Sky clearly one of the major symbols used throughout the album Its twin inclusion of both the Chevrolet and the Sky from the album cover Its distance from its subject matter this is the song that is least dependent on concrete personal details and hence most clearly allegorical The breadth of its scope At its most narrow the album examines particular characters at particular points in their own personal cycles of enchantment disenchantment Stepping back a little farther parts of the album look at this cycle as a whole But this song not only does that but takes the perspective of the artist the person writing us these songs and telling us these tales and examines his role as not only the enchanted but the enchanter the person trying to hot wire reality Looking at all the perspectives we will find in the album it is this one that seems the most comprehensive liberation https reasontorock com elements liberation html berry https reasontorock com artists chuck berry html kerouac http jackkerouac com Track 6 For a Dancer Where The Road and the Sky is the album s manic rocker celebrating the ups and downs of the romantic quest For a Dancer is its quiet heart examining the meaning of death I find this track remarkable in that it combines a very personal tale of loss with an examination of the meaning of physical death and does justice to both While songwriters are practiced at dealing with the subject of love singing about death is a much more difficult task Browne succeeds here by combining specific and personal details with a very clear and unusual perspective The recording begins with just Jackson s voice and piano singing slowly and thoughtfully > Keep a fire burning in your eye > Pay attention to the open sky > You never know what will be coming down Note Browne s oblique approach to his subject as well as another usage of the sky as a symbol this time in the sense of a prime mover from which events emerge an infinite and unforgiving source of beginnings and endings Now Browne moves closer to the central event of the song > I don t remember losing track of you > You were always dancing in and out of view > I must have thought you d always be around > Always keeping things real by playing the clown > Now you re nowhere to be found He continues his oblique approach talking at first only about losing track of someone Also note that he is singing to the person he has lost as if the dancer were in some sense still present in his life In these few lines he also deftly introduces the theme of dancing and uses the term in the sense of moving closer and farther away this playful use of the term resonating with the image of the dancer playing the clown Finally though Browne states that she is nowhere to be found the sombre tone of this final line suggesting her physical death Doug Haywood s bass joins Browne on found the last word of the last line and begins an eloquent questioning dialogue with Browne s piano Now drums join them as well at the beginning of the next verse accelerating the pace of the song and providing it with a more regular forward movement somewhat counteracting the direct introduction of the song s subject > I don t know what happens when people die > Can t seem to grasp it as hard as I try > It s like a song I can hear > Playing right in my ear > That I can t sing > I can t help listening Note how Browne pulls back from the direct examination of the dancer s death into a more general discussion of the subject thus avoiding an immersion into pathos His matter of fact statement that he doesn t know what happens when people die catches us a bit off guard and pulls us into more emotionally neutral territory perfectly setting us up for the surprise and searing depth of the simile that follows comparing death to an elusive tune that the singer can hear but not reproduce Now Browne returns to the personal tale standing at graveside as his friend is lowered into her grave As you listen note that the singer is now joined by additional musicians and background singers creating a sense of a shared community serving the same function in the song as friends and family might at an actual service helping to reduce our sense of loss by reminding us of those we still have by our side > And I can t help feeling stupid standing round > Crying as they ease you down > Cause I know that you d rather we were dancing > Dancing our sorrow away > Right on dancing > No matter what fate chooses to play > There s nothing you can do about it anyway Here again Browne skirts any typical treatment of his subject matter for though he reports his tears the emotion he comments on is of feeling stupid Still addressing the lost dancer he now talks of dancing directly and as a way of finding joyful purpose despite the vagaries of life Expressing this joy his voice surges on the last line soaring above the instruments As the musical group starts the next verse they do so with a sense of joy and unison banding together to confront the darkness > Just do the steps that you ve been shown > By everyone you ve ever known > Until the dance becomes your very own > No matter how close to yours > Another s steps have grown > In the end there is one dance you ll do alone Here it is almost as if the dancer is speaking to the singer rather than the other way around The dancer s message emphasizes both the community in which we grow and that nurtures us as well as the individuality of each person s expression within that community and the ultimate isolation wrought by death Note how the music matches the words on the last line with the background singers growing quiet leaving Browne to sing those words alone David Lindley s violin plays now finally giving voice to the sadness Browne has avoided directly confronting with his words yet at the same time dancing himself as if expressing the spirit of the lost dancer as well as those who mourn her passing With Lindley now having touched the tragic core of the singer s tale Browne is now freed to step back and take a broader view > Keep a fire for the human race > Let your prayers go drifting into space > You never know what will be coming down Note how the words here mirror the first three lines that started the song starting with Keep a fire and ending with You never know what will be coming down Yet something has changed for the singer is no longer alone but is accompanied by others this time around both instrumentalists and singers At the same time his view is broader taking the perspective of the human race as a whole in contrast to the individual lives of the singer and the dancer with which he started > Perhaps a better world is drawing near > Just as easily it could all disappear > Along with whatever meaning you might have found > Don t let the uncertainty turn you around > The world keeps turning around and around > Go on and make a joyful sound Here Browne speaks directly to the album s thematic core talking about our need to create meaning for ourselves and others even if that meaning has no ultimate reality Again as in The Road and the Sky Browne clearly chooses a side chooses joy and meaning and intention despite their lack of permanence despite the absence of any indication that these arise from any source other than the human spirit itself Browne and company now launch triumphantly into the final verse again seemingly expressing a message from the missing dancer > Into a dancer you have grown > From a seed somebody else has thrown > Go on ahead and throw some seeds of your own > And somewhere between the time you arrive > And the time you go > May lie a reason you were alive > But you ll never know So now the song concludes with the singer having himself become a dancer Now we can see that the dramatic movement of the song has not been into death but a transcendence of death with the lost dancer passing something on to the singer who remains behind The song ends not with a death but with a birth as if the singer has emerged from a chrysalis He now knows what it means to dance to create meaning through his movements even though the universe may never acknowledge that meaning Musically the song ends with piano bass organ and violin dancing together one last time before bringing the track to a close I can t think of another song that is at the same time so sombre and so joyous that deals with such a tragic event and at the same time delivers such a sense of overarching meaning and purpose that so skillfully manages to evoke the tragedy and finality of death yet places that death in a larger context without resorting to some divine deus ex machina as the source of that context This song is just a magnificent achievement Track 7 Walking Slow This is a fun upbeat number just the thing to give us some casual good times before the more serious closer of Track 8 Before the Deluge Note that despite the light tone of the recording and the slight ambitions of the lyrics the song is much more than just filler Let s follow along with Browne s journey on this track > Walking slow down the avenue > Through my old neighborhood > Don t know why I m happy > I ve got no reason to feel this good > Maybe it s because I m all alone > And I ve got no place to go > And everywhere I look I see > Another person I ll never know > > I got a thing or two to say > Before I walk on by > I m feeling good today > But if die a little farther along > I m trusting everyone to carry on > > Pretty little girl > Running up and down the street with no shoes on > I got a pretty little girl of my own at home > Sometimes we forget we love each other > And we fight for no reason > I don t know what I ll do if she ever leaves me alone > > I got a thing or two to say > Before I walk on by > I m feelin good today > But if I die a little farther along > I m trustin everyone to carry on > > I m puttin down my left foot > I m puttin down my right foot > > I got a thing or two to say > Before I walk on by > I m feelin good today > But if I die a little farther along > I m trusting everyone to carry on This song offers some remarkable balance within the album Compared to the complex problems and tensions explored in many of the other songs here Browne seems to be saying hey it s alright just to walk down the street with no particular place to go and no companions and just enjoy yourself And it s ok to enjoy a simple romantic relationship that has its ups and downs And it s ok to combine a knowledge of our own mortality with a simple sense that we re part of a human tradition and the weight of the world is not all ours to bear alone If just viewed by itself this song is almost a throw away But when placed within its rightful context within the album it performs a vital function filling out the overall sense of the whole Track 8 Before the Deluge This is the closing song of the album the track that Browne leaves us with This is a complex piece thematically Rather than commenting on one section at a time let s just start by looking at the lyrics as a whole accompanied by the music of course > Some of them were dreamers > And some of them were fools > Who were making plans and thinking of the future > With the energy of the innocent > They were gathering the tools > They would need to make their journey back to nature > > While the sand slipped through the opening > And their hands reached for the golden ring > When their hearts they turned to each other s hearts for refuge > In the troubled years that came before the deluge > > Some of them knew pleasure > And some of them knew pain > And for some of them it was only the moment that mattered > And on the brave and crazy wings of youth > They went flying around in the rain > And their feathers once so fine grew torn and tattered > > And in the end they traded their tired wings > For the resignation that living brings > And exchanged love s bright and fragile glow > For the glitter and the rouge > And in a moment they were swept before the deluge > > Let the music keep our spirits high > Let the buildings keep our children dry > Let creation reveal its secrets by and by by and by > When the light that s lost within us reaches the sky > > Some of them were angry > At the way the earth was abused > By the men who learned how to forge her beauty into power > And they struggled to protect her from them > Only to be confused > By the magnitude of her fury in the final hour > > And when the sand was gone and the time arrived > In the naked dawn only a few survived > And in attempts to understand a thing so simple and so huge > Believed that they were meant to live after the deluge > > Let the music keep our spirits high > Let the buildings keep our children dry > Let creation reveal its secrets by and by by and by > When the light that s lost within us reaches the sky So what can we observe about this song First note that it seems to spell out in detail an event first alluded to in the closing of Track 5 The Road and the Sky Next we can note that the events in the song spell out a sort of allegory that parallels in action and feeling much of what happened to Browne s generation in the late sixties and early seventies So while Browne doesn t speak of specific events his story outlines the overall arc of youthful consciousness during this period a desire to experience a simpler more holistic relationship with nature anger at the military industrial complex hopeful innocence followed by resignation and disillusionment a naïve spreading of wings with insufficient concern for future consequences Browne s accomplishment here is hard to overstate he s not just recounting facts and dates he s not telling us what happened to specific people rather he s singing us a tale that allows us to feel intensely what it was like to live through this period And of course when listening to Browne s song it brings to mind other works of narrative fiction that touch on similar themes such as Overstory the Pulitzer Prize winning novel by Richard Powers and Arcadia the novel by Lauren Groff And then finally there s the lovely chorus with which the song and album end > Let the music keep our spirits high The first line reminds us of the importance of art and dreams and enchantment > Let the buildings keep our children dry The next line reminds us of the importance of practical necessities as well as the reponsibilities that come once we ve outgrown our own childhoods > Let creation reveal its secrets by and by The third line reminds us that this state of not knowing in which we all live this experience of mystery is not a problem to be solved not a question to be answered but one of the most profound and enduring elements of our human existence > When the light that s lost within us reaches the sky And then this final line returns us to the mystery with which we began our journey the light and the sky from the album cover the light lost by the couple in the opening song Late for the Sky the song playing in the singer s ear in For a Dancer In Summary What a beautiful album what an amazing achievement what a powerful work of art At the beginning of the sixties and before popular music was focused on individual songs and individual tracks hit singles if you will As rock artists grew in artistic maturity in the latter half of the sixties they began to conceive of their albums as artistic wholes rather than a few hit singles accompanied by enough filler to pad out an LP Many of these albums relied on a consistent sound and approach to the music as their unifying elements think of The Beatles Revolver Others relied on a consistent sound and a consistent approach to their lyrics and selection of subject matter think of Beggar s Banquet by The Rolling Stones or Blonde on Blonde by Bob Dylan A few artists tried to create albums as rock operas with some limited success What very few ever accomplished though was to create an album such as Late for the Sky in which the individual tracks don t just feel like they belong together but actually fit together to make a lyrical whole greater than the sum of its parts I think Springsteen got it right when he referred to this album as a masterpiece and Stephen Holden got it right in his original review of this album for Rolling Stone when he referred to Browne s lyric genius If later pop revisionism somehow decided that the tunes weren t catchy enough the lyrics required too much thought or the sales figures weren t impressive enough then I think the fault is more in the ears and minds of the critics than in the material itself This album is a touchstone for me A framed print of Bob Seidemann s cover art hangs in my living room I have many songs I love many recordings of those songs many albums And I return to these not just out of familiarity or to use as background music but because they provide me with a deep sense of meaning about the life I have lived the life I am still living and the lives of those around me But even among these pieces of art this album stands out for me as the most unified and coherent and meaningful album in my collection I hope you find as much joy and meaning in it as I do"

I think > it s somehow part of the fabric of our culture Country singer Rodney Crowell Marcus 2005 Like A Rolling Stone is not only one of the most popular rock songs of all time it is also one of those whose appeal is the most mysterious Whereas it is easy to see how other Dylan songs became anthems for a generation songs like Blowin in the Wind The Times They Are A Changing and Mr Tambourine Man it is harder to see how this song attained such a broad and enthusiastic audience A song like Blowin In The Wind https www bobdylan com songs blowin wind appealed to the masses by asking a series of pointed moral questions and then explicitly saying that the questions are unanswerable But the climactic line of this song is itself an unanswerable question and one with less obvious relevance How does it feel to be like a Rolling Stone What on earth was going on here and why did people get so excited by it As we will see the greatness of the song lies in the intricacy of its working the way so many parts come together to make a cohesive compelling and unique whole The challenge in describing the recording is to look at it piece by piece and yet still be able to put it back together at the end and see it work Let s take it a step at a time A good place to start is in the relationship of the words to the music A criticism leveled at much of rock and at Dylan in particular as he began making rock music rather than folk was that the words were hard to hear Certainly in much of rock music this was true and intentional foreground and background merged the words and vocals became part of the mix part of a wall of sound in some cases But in this recording that usual criticism does not apply It is not that the music is not full and loud organ piano electric guitar and bass drums and tambourine are all working together making for a complex musical tapestry But all this music never overwhelms the vocals As a matter of fact they simply form a rich background with Dylan s vocals clearly in the foreground every word and nasal intonation clearly etched and standing out in sharp relief from the instruments This will mean more to us as we come to understand more of the song but for now let s just take this to mean that the words are important and need to be understood > Hey man you know I can t I mean I m just me you know I can t > really man I m just playing the song I know I don t want to > scream it that s all I know Bob Dylan speaking to musicians during the recording sessions for Like A Rolling Stone Marcus 2005 So with that thought in mind let s look at the lyrics https www bobdylan com songs rolling stone and see what they have to say Note that I ve broken the verses into short lines at times to make it easier to see the rhyming scheme more on this later > Once upon a time > You dressed so fine > You threw the bums a dime > In your prime > Didn t you > > People d call > Say Beware doll > You re bound to fall > You thought they were all > Kiddin you > > You used to laugh about > Everybody that was hangin out > Now you don t > talk so loud > Now you don t > seem so proud > About having to be scrounging > for your next meal > > How does it feel > How does it feel > To be without a home > Like a complete unknown > Like a rolling stone > > You ve gone to the finest school > All right Miss Lonely > But you know you only > Used to get > Juiced in it > > And nobody has ever taught you > How to live on the street > And now you find out > You re gonna have to get > Used to it > > You said you d never compromise > With the mystery tramp but now you realize > He s not selling any alibis > As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes > And ask him do you want to > Make a deal > > How does it feel > How does it feel > To be on your own > With no direction home > Like a complete unknown > Like a rolling stone > > You never turned around > To see the frowns > On the jugglers and the clowns > When they all come down > And did tricks for you > > You never understood > That it ain t no good > You shouldn t let > Other people get > Your kicks for you > > You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat > Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat > Ain t it hard when you discover that > He really wasn t where it s at > After he took from you everything > He could steal > > How does it feel > How does it feel > To be on your own > With no direction home > Like a complete unknown > Like a rolling stone > > Princess on the steeple > And all the pretty people > They re drinkin thinkin > That they > Got it made > > Exchanging all > Precious gifts > But you d better > Take your diamond ring you d better > Pawn it babe > > You used to be so amused > At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used > Go to him now he calls you you can t refuse > When you ain t got nothing you got nothing to lose > You re invisible now you got no secrets > To conceal > > How does it feel > How does it feel > To be on your own > With no direction home > Like a complete unknown > Like a rolling stone At first glance the song seems to be about class division The woman addressed by the singer is clearly from the upper class having gone to the finest schools consorted with diplomats and exchanged precious gifts with friends and family At the other end of the spectrum we have the mystery tramp and Napoleon in rags The dramatic movement in the song at this level is simple some event has caused the woman to fall from grace to be cast out from the upper social circles and to have joined the ranks of those who have no material possessions There is more going on here though The words are also about illusion and understanding deception and truth The song repeatedly describes ways in which the woman failed to see what was really going on around her She never saw the frowns on the jugglers and the clowns thought that people were joking when they said she was riding for a fall failed to realize that the diplomat was using her and so on It s worth noting how quickly and deftly Dylan introduces all of this The first line encapsulates the class issue and tells us of the woman s fall Once upon a time you dressed so fine threw the bums a dime in your prime didn t you The second line then tells us how blind the woman was to what was going on around her People used to call say Beware doll you re bound to fall you thought they were all kidding you It is instructional to compare this song to a couple of similar ones written about the same time Positively Fourth Street and Ballad of a Thin Man The former is about someone who claims to be a friend of the singer s and concludes with the most biting put down in all of rock Yes I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes Then you d know what a drag it is to see you Similarly the latter talks about someone who is clueless each chorus ending with the line Because something is happening here but you don t know what it is do you Mr Jones In all three of these songs Dylan the singer is directly addressing an individual who has been unaware unenlightened What makes Like A Rolling Stone different from the other two and more interesting is that it is more than just a character sketch more than just a scathing commentary in this song there is dramatic movement the woman who has been unaware has experienced a fall and from that experience has an opportunity to change to learn to grow And brilliantly each verse describes one more experience from which the subject might learn takes the subject to the brink of enlightenment asks the key questions whose answers would provide resolution then stops begins again and repeats the process Now let s turn next to the structure of the song Let s start with just the first four mini lines as shown above > Once upon a time > You dressed so fine > You threw the bums a dime > In your prime The short line length the fairy tale opening the simple words and images the straightforward aaaa repeating rhyme all these elements work together to create the feeling of a children s song of a child s world Little miss Muffet Sat on a Tuffet Eating her curds and whey uses similar devices to similar effect for example In conjunction with the themes we have discussed these devices suggest that the woman in our story started her adventure with a certain childish simplistic approach to life apparently thinking that everything around her was placed there solely for her own amusement But then Dylan does something really interesting The first extended line or verse or whatever we call it the first sentence certainly is not yet finished The singer pauses and then tosses off the following question > Didn t you What is this A fifth line that doesn t rhyme with any of the first four yet is clearly part of this first sentence Do you see what Dylan is doing He is using the very structure of the song to let us know to let the woman know that there is more going on more to the song and more to life than this simple children s world The words are about illusion and reality deception and truth But the lines verses and rhymes are also playing with these same ideas first making us think that this is a simple children s song then showing us a larger world of which this childish beginning is no more than a piece The next extended line uses the same structure > People d call > Say Beware doll > You re bound to fall > You thought they were all > Kiddin you But note that by pairing these two similar verses and ending that hanging fifth line with the same rhyme in both the same word in this case he is at the same time building a larger structure a richer pattern So now we can see that the longer rhyming scheme is aaaab ccccb Thematically the effect is in concert with the words the gradual revelation of a larger more complex world than the one we started with Let s see what comes next > You used to laugh about > Everybody that was hangin out > Now you don t > talk so loud > Now you don t > seem so proud > About having to be scrounging > for your next meal This is a different melody now and a different verse structure The rhyming pattern is now ddeefg Again though Dylan employs the same device ending the line verse sentence with an unmatched rhyme leaving us hanging waiting for closure wondering how the pattern completes itself Now finally we hit the chorus > How does it feel > How does it feel > To be without a home > Like a complete unknown > Like a rolling stone Do you see what happened there How does it feel is repeated The first occurrence rhymes with the last line of the preceding verse For your next meal and also rhymes with the second How does it feel So we end up with a 5 line chorus with the last three lines rhyming finally leaving us with no unfinished business no unrhymed lines The whole intricate pattern one line dovetailing with the next has now been revealed And it is nothing like what we started with nothing like a simple children s song Look at the whole rhyming scheme aaaab ccccb ddeefg gghhh And so of course having just created one of the most interesting powerful and unusual verse chorus structures in all of rock Dylan proceeds to get maximum value for it he repeats it three more times with different words all reinforcing and building on the same story the same themes his only variation being minor deviations from the strict aaaa rhyming scheme of the first two lines > I had them play me the fucking thing five times straight before I > could say anything What I realized while I was sitting there was that > one of US one of the so called Village hipsters was making music > that could compete with THEM the Beatles and the Stones and the Dave > Clark Five without sacrificing any of the integrity of folk music or > the power of rock n roll Record Producer Paul Rothchild Marcus 2005 The music reinforces and adds to the meaning found in the words We begin with a single crack of a drum stroke a brief pause then we are suddenly immersed in a rich swirling mix of organ piano guitars drums and tambourine Musically the chord structure is regular almost stately with a rising cadence to the first two lines a brief pause at the top then a descending cadence to the last couple of lines before entering the chorus The group Procul Harum achieved a similar effect with organ and overt use of Bach s melodies in their song A Whiter Shade of Pale but here Dylan and companions achieve a classical church like feel with similar instruments and Dylan s chords and melodies It s hard to find words that do justice here The music is at the same time ethereal and earthy classical and improvisational stately and sensuous austere and warm hallowed and irreverent The instruments weave together in intricate patterns yet at the same time move the song along at a measured pace alternately relaxing and pushing at just the right places supporting and emphasizing the effects of the words The overall effect is of being in a church yet a church that acknowledges all the rich complexities and mysteries of human existence foregoing any easy moral judgments And always even when a discordant note is struck even when things do not turn out to be simple or straightforward there is this haunting pervasive beauty The way in which this studio recording was created resonates with the story expressed through the lyrics The epilogue to Greil Marcus wonderful book Like A Rolling Stone Bob Dylan at the Crossroads transcribes much of the conversation that took place during the two days of recording sessions This was a temporary assemblage of musicians who had never played together before It included Michael Bloomfield a young blues guitar wizard of the time who was brought in and then expressly told not to play his typical blues runs It also included Al Kooper on organ even though his preferred instrument at the time was guitar and producer Tom Wilson laughed when he saw him sitting behind this instrument that was so unfamiliar to him There is nothing like any sort of system evident in the recording session To traditional professional musicians it would have seemed like mayhem There were no charts no arrangement Dylan lacked any sort of language to convey to the others whatever sound he may have wished to hear It seems simply a process of trial and error and mostly error with the recording tape continually rolling ready to capture whatever might emerge and with most of the takes breaking down mid song after obvious failures There was general satisfaction expressed after only one take the one that eventually became the master but even then there was no indication that anyone thought that they were done or had produced what would eventually be hailed as the most masterful rock recording of all time So we can see that just as Dylan tells the woman in the song that the simple order to her life was an illusion there was no simple obvious order to the way in which this masterpiece was recorded The music was recorded by musicians who were then unknowns who were themselves rolling stones Bloomfield walked into the recording studio with his guitar slung over his shoulder not even having a case for it who happened to come together for a few days to work together in this loose fashion and then moved on The recording sessions were themselves a reflection of this reality that Dylan was singing about What is also evident in the transcripts from the recording sessions is the difficulty not only of producing a masterpiece but of playing the song with any sort of success whatsoever This is also evident by the facts that even though this song is famous it has been covered by other artists on relatively few occasions and with nothing like the success of this originally released recording As with many other rock works of art the recording is of a piece lyrics music vocals instruments all come together to make a whole without any of the parts being able to stand on their own even the song itself > I m used to there being a music director Having grown up in the > studio there was always someone in charge whether it was the > arranger the artist or the producer There was no one in charge at > that session in charge of the general chaos Al Kooper talking about the recording sessions that produced Like A Rolling Stone Marcus 2005 On top of all this rich instrumental tapestry is Dylan s voice The beginning melody reveals the influence of Chuck Berry with complete lack of melodic variation all the interest coming from the rhythmic nuances Dylan takes the opening words the simple children s song and sings all the notes at the same pitch again emphasizing the simplicity of this opening worldview with a stop and go rhythm the only musical element hinting at something more complex Again it is hard to find enough to say about Dylan s singing It rides easily on top of the music so that he is free to raise the volume for emphasis but does not need to scream to be heard It is full of real human inflection and character yet also delivers the melody and the words His voice pours out with the texture of Kentucky bourbon country molasses or Tupelo honey thick and rich and full of character with a slightly nasal twang The delivery is not free of emotion yet neither is it overly emotional there is no feeling of condemnation or anger in his words But listen to the way he carves the edge off the notes when he sings your next meal stretching the final word sliding from one note to another within the same syllable sounding like a buzz saw approaching a knot in the wood Or listen to the Awww before he starts the second verse You ve gone to the finest school Dylan the singer the character in the song is completely at home here He is free to be himself There is no pretense no artifice no strain no discomfort In this complex world this life of tragedy and betrayal of discovery and regret of adventure and mystery he is simply himself and a match for the world > The voice is infinitely nuanced at times almost an authoritarian > monotone not unlike Ginsberg reading Howl at times compassionate > tragic the voice of Jacques Louis David in his painting of Marat > but also angry vengeful gleeful ironic weary spectral > haranguing And it would sound this way in ancient Greek or > contemporary Russian There is so much desire and so much power in > this voice translated into a sensitivity that enables it to detect > tiny vibrations Composer Michael Pisaro Marcus 2005 On this note considering Dylan the singer and his presence in the song let s come back to the song as a dramatic work For there is something else happening here something we have not discussed yet The main character in the song seemingly is the woman whom we are observing who is being described with a cast of minor characters all around her Yet there is another major character the singer himself We know nothing about his actions In fact one of the unexplained mysteries of the song is the relationship between the singer and the woman There is no reference made to how they know each other To our knowledge Dylan has been neither friend nor lover Yet his presence in the song is too strong for him to simply be some neutrally omniscient observer And the artistry of his observation the craft of the song the sharp penetration of his insights into the woman s life the music of his companions and the sheer presence of his voice make him a person a character in the story Who is he and what role does he play One could call him by many names the joker the observer the teacher But ultimately he is the artist He is one who observes life who is involved in life and yet can step back and see the larger whole and fashion his own expression to reflect and comment on and mirror this reality He is one who can immerse himself in all the gritty details of life yet never lose sight of a larger picture He is one who can stand in the vacuum of the eyes of the mystery tramp and feel no need for a simpler and more comforting reality He is one who sees and understands what is going on around him sees through the illusions sees the truth and sings of it expressing all this rich complexity through art As Dylan said of blues singer Robert Johnson He seems to know about everything Neither forlorn or hopeless or shackled nothing hinders him Dylan 2004 Now finally let us consider this final haunting question that ends every chorus that ends the song that completes all the patterns How does it feel to be like a rolling stone Here we find it impossible to consider this phrase in isolation for it resonates throughout the rock generation One of rock s greatest bands named themselves The Rolling Stones The most famous journal of the times was called Rolling Stone magazine To understand the power of this phrase let us go back to a blues song originally written and recorded by Muddy Waters in 1950 It is a simple haunting recording just Muddy s voice his electric guitar and the bass of Ernest Big Crawford Musically there is little in common with Dylan s song There is power and dignity in Muddy s voice and in the raw stinging beauty of his electric guitar phrases But the story he tells https genius com Muddy waters rollin stone lyrics like that of many blues songs is one of failure of lives barely realized lives where opportunities are so few that their losses never even rise to the level of tragedy Muddy says he wishes he could be a catfish swimming in the deep blue sea He visits a woman who is cheating on her husband He remembers his mother predicting that he would be a rolling stone Then he talks about going back down the road saying his time isn t long That s it His voice and guitar trail off at the end of each verse repeating each final line three times with falling inflection and volume reinforcing the failure and aimlessness implicit in the words the sense that we will never know how this life ends that he will simply fade out leaving only this song as testament to his life This phrase also appears in the song Lost Highway written by Leon Payne recorded by Hank Williams and partially sung by Bob Dylan in D A Pennebaker s film documentary Don t Look Back > I m a rolling stone all alone and lost > For a life of sin I have paid the cost > When I pass by all the people say > Just another guy on the lost highway A rolling stone what did this phrase mean to Dylan as he offered it up conclusively the music exultantly punctuating his words surging soaring around him And what did this phrase and this song mean to a generation of mostly white kids singing and listening to rock music in the sixties and seventies Consider their situation on one hand members of this generation had the predominant white culture that they were immersed in had grown up with affluent successful powerful On the other hand they had a legacy of blues folk and country singers and those they sang about poor disenfranchised powerless Yet miraculously many of these children and young adults growing up in the sixties discovered there was another dimension to this cultural contrast For despite having all the obvious advantages many members of the predominant white culture were essentially clueless much like the woman that Dylan sings about They drank too much they laughed too loud they noticed too little the prices paid for their fun by those around them they realized far too little of what was really going on even as their leaders swept them into tragic and ultimately meaningless conflict in Viet Nam And yet despite having almost none of these same advantages these blues country and folk artists created authentic original and meaningful artistic expression and obtained the dignity understanding and clarity of vision that goes along with all of this So this phrase a rolling stone that meant a lack of material possessions a lack of home a lack of belonging for those who first sang it became a symbol of liberation https www reasontorock com elements liberation html for the rock generation Because those who adopted it Bob Dylan Brian Jones and Jann Wenner saw and made us see that these material ties also enslaved us restricted our perspective blurred our vision dulled our senses and blinded us to our own creative potential This is why Dylan asks the question How does it feel to be like a rolling stone And this is why millions sang along with him For he is singing not about the reversal of fortune of one woman but about the transformation of a generation He is singing this phrase because in allowing ourselves to feel the answer to this question we were at least for some of us and at least for some time able to liberate ourselves from our position and our place able to see through the deceit and illusion around us and able to achieve that clear transcendent crystalline vision that can only be bestowed by art and artist Like A Rolling Stone is a song about values about meaning about the transformative nature of art about human development and about the complex fabric of human existence It contrasts the importance of perception insight and an integral view of the world with the more transient solace of material possessions and gratification of worldly desires It is about a system of values in which the possession of money status and power is less important than the ability to creatively express our deepest feelings and most enduring sensibilities the ability to make and appreciate art > This is about growing up this is about discovering what is going on > around you realizing that life isn t all you ve been told So now > you re without a home you re on your own complete unknown like a > rolling stone That s a liberating thing This is a song about > liberation Jann Wenner publisher of Rolling Stone

        summary: "<p>My earliest memory of this song is hearing it on the first album by The Band, <em>Music from Big Pink</em>, back in 1968. </p>", 
        content: "My earliest memory of this song is hearing it on the first album by The Band Music from Big Pink back in 1968 I understood then that this was the one song on the album that was written neither by members of The Band nor by Bob Dylan but didn t know much else about it at the time Then a few years later I discovered that it was one of the few songs that my father and I both knew and could play together on our guitars Turned out he had probably heard it as recorded by The Country Gentlemen on their 1960 album Country Songs Old New or had simply heard this same group perform the song at one of their many shows at the Crossroads outside of DC a venue my dad was known to have frequented And then I found the song included on the Rosanne Cash album The List the title referring to a list of essential American songs as identified by her father Johnny Cash But then later it just started to turn up everywhere I recently heard it on The Pizza Tapes a loose album recorded by Jerry Garcia David Grisman and Tony Rice And when I just searched for it on Apple Music I found a live version by the Dave Matthews Band And of course Mick Jagger sang it with The Chieftains on an album named after the song And my wife and I even heard it performed by Jackshit https www jackshittheband com earlier this year Let s just review the lyrics now so that they re fresh in all our minds > Ten years ago on a cold dark night > There was someone killed neath the town hall light > There were few at the scene but they all agreed > That the slayer who ran looked a lot like me > > The judge said Son what is your alibi > If you were somewhere else then you won t have to die > I spoke not a word though it meant my life > For I d been in the arms of my best friend s wife > > She walks these hills in a long black veil > She visits my grave when the night winds wail > Nobody knows nobody sees > Nobody knows but me > > The scaffold is high and eternity s near > She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear > But sometimes at night when the cold wind moans > In a long black veil she cries over my bones > > She walks these hills in a long black veil > She visits my grave when the night winds wail > Nobody knows nobody sees > Nobody knows but me Given its apparent status as a standard one might think this to be some ancient tune composed somewhere in the Appalachian hills early in the last century And the timeless nature of the lyrics certainly lend themselves to that sort of thinking And the public execution of the narrator on a gallows seems to imply an event happening before 1936 when the last public hanging occurred in the US But it turns out the song is really not that old Long Black Veil was composed by Danny Dill and Marijohn Wilkin in 1959 and originally recorded by Lefty Frizzell whose single reached 6 on the country music charts Given its seemingly timeless popularity the song is perhaps worth some analysis and commentary The basic material seems to come straight out of the bluegrass tradition given the tragic fate of the two lovers But whereas it is sometimes said of bluegrass If you want to feel sad listen to the lyrics if you want to feel happy listen to the music there is nothing happy about the music here It is profoundly and unremittingly sad and often dirgelike But it also dead simple to play on guitar and not terribly challenging for a singer which are most likely other reasons why it turns up so often The song is deceptively simple only three verses and a chorus In fact the lack of detail is notable none of the characters are given a name there is no description of any of their physical characteristics and the song has nothing to say about the reasons for the narrator s love of the woman in the song Yet no word is wasted and the overall construction of the song is brilliant it is all action character and atmosphere Let s break it down > Ten years ago We are immediately made to understand that we are talking about events that happened some time ago which perhaps helps to explain why the words are being delivered without much immediate emotion > On a cold dark night Well now we ve got the atmosphere established > There was someone killed neath the town hall light Now we know the event that starts the story along with a few words to help us picture the surroundings And we ve got the couplet structure that will continue throughout the song one line anticipating the closure to come with the next > There were few at the scene but they all agreed > That the slayer who ran looked a lot like me The narrator s role in the story is now introduced along with foreshadowing of the events to come We know that there were few at the scene and it happened at night beneath a single light so we can imagine that the eye witness observations were imperfect and yet they all agreed that the killer looked a lot like the narrator so we can already imagine how this might appear to a judge and jury Also note that the use of the archaic term slayer again gives the impression that the song was written long ago And here I ll comment that although the chorus is sometimes first delivered following this initial verse that is wrong as it breaks the dramatic structure of the song So let s move on to the second verse > The judge said Son what is your alibi > If you were somewhere else then you won t have to die Now here I ll just observe that although many early folk songs about tragic lovers were not particularly concerned with the delivery of justice and did not always depict those in power as being scrupulously fair the judge here seems blameless and in fact seems to be going out of his way to encourage the narrator to offer up an alibi And so there is no questioning here of the social order no concerns about class structures > I spoke not a word though it meant my life > For I d been in the arms of my best friend s wife And so now we have all the players identified and we know the rest of what was happening on the night of the murder And the sense of foreboding continues to build as we see the bind in which the narrator is trapped And so now with the lover introduced and the relationships explained it s time for the revelations of the chorus > She walks these hills in a long black veil > She visits my grave when the night winds wail > Nobody knows nobody sees > Nobody knows but me And so now for the first time we realize that this is a ghost story that the person speaking to us has been dead and buried these ten long years And we know that the woman s secret affair was never revealed that her illicit relationship remained a secret and yet she still remains in mourning for her lost lover visiting his grave in a long black veil when the night winds wail If this doesn t send chills up your spine then you must be immune to this sort of stuff And now the depiction of the narrator s final moments along with a retelling of the later actions of his lover > The scaffold is high and eternity s near > She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear > But sometimes at night when the cold wind moans > In a long black veil she cries over my bones Upon sober reflection I sometimes think this song might have been conjured up in between watching episodes of Gunsmoke Perry Mason and The Twilight Zone all of which were playing on television in the year the song was written rather than being drawn from any deeper wells of the American experience or of its expression through song This is not as big a stretch as it might at first sound The Country Gentlemen https en wikipedia org wiki The Country Gentlemen on their album Live in Japan identified an episode of The Twilight Zone as the inspiration for their somewhat similar ghost song Bringing Mary Home https www bluegrasslyrics com song bringing mary home But the song is universal in its themes despite the ostensibly American trappings It is a song about justice and the need to pay for one s sins in this case violation of two of the Ten Commandments commission of adultery and coveting of thy neighbor s wife It is a song about faithfulness and loyalty with the narrator unwilling to compromise the position of his lover and with the lover continuing to secretly weep over the narrator s grave even ten years after his death And it is a song that attempts to offer meaningful answers to this question that always torments us what lives on if anything after we die + The singer says that eternity nears as he is preparing for death implying that there are some things over which time has no hold some things that do outlast our mortal coils And his speaking to us from beyond the grave again implies some sort of eternity And what form does this eternity take + Ethical principles live on and the events of our lives can help to exemplify those important principles for those that follow especially if they are immortalized in song and passed on from one to the other + Love can survive death and serve as a testament to the enduring meaning of those whose lives have been lost Is it any wonder that the song has been passed on from one singer to another so continuously and that it continues to hold meaning for those who sing it and those who hear It s a beautiful classic and deserves to be sung wherever there are humans who remember and humans to listen"

        content: "I ve already written about Long Black Veil which was one one of my father s favorite songs So I m probably overdue to write about Pancho and Lefty which was one of my father in law s favorites and one of mine as well A bit like Hallelujah by Leonard Cohen this song seems to have had an interesting life of its own It was written by Townes Van Zandt a legendary Texan singer songwriter and first released on his album The Late Great Townes Van Zandt back in 1972 Neither the song nor the album received a whole lot of attention at the time let alone any accolades Then Emmylou Harris recorded it on her album Luxury Liner in 1977 giving the song a bit more exposure And then finally Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard recorded it in 1983 and released it as a single which promptly became a huge hit for the pair As the story goes Willie Nelson s daughter introduced the song to them While the earlier recordings are sincere and heartfelt there is no denying that the Nelson Haggard recording has become the definitive version with the vocals and instrumentation bringing out all the nuance and details of the song While Cohen spent years working on the lyrics to Hallelujah Van Zandt said of this song I realize that I wrote it but it s hard to take credit for the writing because it came from out of the blue And then Nelson and Haggard recorded their incredible version over the course of an evening and then shipped it off to the record company the next morning So in both cases the music seemed to just flow for the artists without seeming effort However these creative acts happened though there s no doubt that both the song itself and the Nelson Haggard recording are about as good as it gets both for songwriters and for singers and recording artists Before we dive in to the lyrics a couple of notes the spelling of the first name has evolved over the years starting out as Poncho and then later becoming established as Pancho And although the Pancho character in the song may have been partly inspired by the life of Pancho Villa no sort of historical accuracy was intended Certainly one of the themes to be found in the song is the continual unfolding of time contrasting innocence and experience comparing our original ideas and intentions with our eventual acts and their consequences Notice how the story plays out like a relay of some kind with each character having their moment on the stage but then passing the baton on to another This all happens in a dreamlike manner and so it is not too surprising that the song just came to Van Zandt without conscious thought Notice also how the action of the song is generally described in the past tense even though our understanding of the future time from which the story is told evolves as the song progresses So now here we go > Living on the road my friend > Was gonna keep you free and clean > Now you wear your skin like iron > And your breath s as hard as kerosene Who is speaking and who is the friend It could well be Van Zandt talking to himself or Nelson and Haggard talking to themselves or any concerned friend talking to any performing singer musician Or someone talking to a friend who has chosen the life of a bandit This song was written at the start of what would become known as the Outlaw Country https en wikipedia org wiki Outlaw country movement both because its practitioners were intentionally working outside the traditional confines of the Nashville recording business but also because they often identified with outlaws Notice though that we already have the unfolding of time contrasting the innocence of the friend s original intention keeping free and clean with his eventual experience skin as hard as iron breath like kerosene And now the baton gets passed to the mother of our character > You weren t your mama s only boy > But her favorite one it seems > She began to cry when you said goodbye > And sank into your dreams More time unfolding with the innocent expectations of a mother contrasting with the dreams of her son leading to his departure And let us pause to appreciate the unusual phrasing saying that the character sank into his dreams The words imply the power of the character s subconscious pulling him downward with the unrelenting force of gravity so much being said in so few words And now the baton gets passed to Pancho Is this the same character whose mama cried when he said goodbye I tend to think so But no matter In any case it is a new scene a new chapter > Well Pancho was a bandit boy > His horse was fast as polished steel > He wore his gun outside his pants > For all the honest world to feel Here even though Pancho was a bandit he s presented in a romantic fashion He s not pretending to be anything other than what he is and he s got the stuff it takes to be a successful bandit the fastest horse and so on Was this how Van Zandt thought of himself Certainly many others thought of him as having the best songwriting And Nelson and Haggard recorded their version in Nelson s studio at his home in Texas without any aid from anyone in Nashville > Pancho met his match you know > On the deserts down in Mexico > Nobody heard his dying words > Ah but that s the way it goes Pancho leaves the stage as quickly as he entered Again we have the rapid unfolding of time with Pancho s success as a bandit giving way to his lonely demise And now the baton is passed to the Federales the federal forces charged with the enforcement of the law and the maintenance of social order > All the Federales say > They could have had him any day > They only let him slip away > Out of kindness I suppose And even though they presumably had a hand in stopping Pancho s exploits this group is presented as a sad and ineffective bunch quick to brag about their supposed accomplishments but apparently not so quick or eager to face Pancho head on and apparently not equipped with the fastest horses And now the baton is passed to Lefty > Lefty he can t sing the blues > All night long like he used to > The dust that Pancho bit down south > Ended up in Lefty s mouth And here the baton actually takes physical form as the dust is passed from Pancho to Lefty > The day they laid poor Pancho low > Lefty split for Ohio > Where he got the bread to go > There ain t nobody knows And so it s clearly implied that Lefty betrayed Pancho apparently telling the Federales where he could be easily ambushed perhaps not unlike the way in which outlaws Bonnie and Clyde were betrayed and gunned down as depicted in Arthur Penn s film from 1967 Again so much being said with so few words so little explicit description of the events that transpired And now more tired bragging from the Federales > All the Federales say > They could have had him any day > We only let him slip away > Out of kindness I suppose And now Haggard s voice comes in bringing the story to a close of sorts revealing the further unfolding of time > The poets tell how Pancho fell > And Lefty s living in a cheap hotel > The desert s quiet Cleveland s cold > And so the story ends we re told So now this poet distances himself from the poets who tell how Pancho fell implying that he s not one of those who mythologizes and romanticizes such stories supplying neat endings in order to provide his listeners with a satisfying tale And so true to his word this songwriter supplies an altogether different and unexpected ending > Pancho needs your prayers it s true > But save a few for Lefty too > He only did what he had to do > And now he s growing old And so the singer seems to imply time inexorably unfolds for us all starting with the purity of innocence but ending with the gritty reality of experience And who can say which of our characters got the better of their encounter in the desert Lefty got the money to go back to the cold of Ohio living out his days in a cheap hotel waking each day to the unrelenting shame of his betrayal no longer with a song to sing not even an honest blues And while Pancho bit the dust he died without ever being untrue to his own character and as a result the poets are still singing about him recounting tales of his exploits But now even after this apparent conclusion the last delivery of the chorus makes it clear that time is still unfolding with the events of the song receding further into the past the tale now only being told by a few aging federales > A few gray Federales say > We could have had him any day > We only let him go so long > Out of kindness I suppose This is such a great song so exquisitely written using common language familiar to anyone who cares to listen but with one surprising event and scene and image and turn of phrase after another The song is itself a story although one told very unconventionally but it is also about story suggesting that we are all authors of our own stories and that we should take care what we write for in the end the stories are what we are left with and what we leave behind Dedicated to Clendon Hendrickson whose story is still told and whose exploits are still recounted"

McCartney Beatles 2000 This track is a profound example of how the lyrics of a song can be extended and amplified by the music Let s start with a little biographical context as first Neil Aspinall The Beatles roadie and then John Lennon primary author of Rain recall The Beatles arrival in Australia > When we arrived in Sydney it was pissing down with rain We got off > the plane and they put The Beatles on the back of a flat back truck so > the crowd could see them Neil Aspinall Beatles 2000 > We were having hysterics laughing It was so funny coming to > Australia and getting on a big van all soaking wet we thought it was > going to be sunny We only got wet for about fifteen minutes but the > kids got wet for hours How could we be disappointed when they came > out to see us and stood in all the rotten wind and rain to wave to us > They were great really great I ve never seen rain as hard as that > except in Tahiti John Lennon Beatles 2000 So you can appreciate the situational and attitudinal backgrounds from which John wrote the lyrics for the song > If the rain comes they run and hide their heads > They might as well be dead > If the rain comes > If the rain comes > > When the sun shines they slip into the shade > And sip their lemonade > When the sun shines > When the sun shines > > Rain I don t mind > Shine the weather s fine > > I can show you that when it starts to rain > Everything s the same > I can show you > I can show you > > Rain I don t mind > Shine the weather s fine > > Can you hear me that when it rains and shines > It s just a state of mind > Can you hear me > Can you hear me At its most obvious level this is a song as John says in the Anthology about people moaning about the weather all the time Beatles 2000 And when the lyrics are taken alone it is hard to make a case for the song being about much of anything else At my count the entire song is written using a vocabulary of only 44 words So you could even make a case that the lyrics offer nothing more than a rough sketch Once we consider the words in the context of the music though they take on added weight First because their reading in the song is so slow with many words stretched out into multiple beats and syllables there is an added emphasis to the lyrics The result is to put more weight on the words than their surface meaning will bear thus suggesting to the listener that there is a hidden or additional meaning The effect is almost revelatory giving the impression that some important secret or prophecy is being disclosed The music also suggests in other ways that the weather is to be taken as a symbol of something else The Beatles do this by making the music itself represent the condition they are describing Paul says in the Anthology On Rain I remember we couldn t get a backing track and we decided to play it fast and slow it down We had to play it fast and accurately Beatles 2000 In other words they played the backing guitar at a fast speed recording this on tape and then played the tape back at a slower speed John also stumbled on the idea of recording a guitar and voices backwards In other words he sang and played guitar along with the backing track while it was being played backwards then reversed the direction of the voice and guitar and combined them with the backing track while being played forward The effect is quite noticeable since it reverses the normal attack and decay rates associated with a guitar There is also Ringo s stop and go drumming on the song and Paul s burbling bass playing a repeated line that varies in tempo and that runs quickly from the lower to the upper register and back again The effect of all these musical devices is to represent the rain or shine polarities in musical terms So The Beatles are in effect saying not only Rain or shine I don t mind but also fast or slow backwards or forwards stop or go high or low As John sings in the song I can show you and he does quite literally And he is referring to more than just the words he is singing when he asks Can you hear me John s voice is even altered further on these last two lines using some other studio effects giving the words a sort of hallucinogenic clarity So the implication is clearly that the vagaries of the weather are at some deeper level symbolic of something else But of what If we take the musical effects to be further symbols then we are at a dead end because there seem to be no further clues We could make a case I suppose for all of this being symbolic of life itself of some universal zen like yin yang Eastern sort of mysticism But this is a vague interpretation that doesn t really add much to the song But what if the musical effects are not symbols but are to some degree the subjects of the song themselves In this case perhaps what we have is a song about the transformative and liberating effects of art With this interpretation The Beatles seem to be saying that it doesn t make much difference what sorts of experiences you have what makes a difference is what you do with those experiences It is not who you are where you come from how much money you make that matter it is whether you choose to live a life of creative expression in which case all of the other details simply become grist for the artistic mill With this interpretation the lines I can show you and Can you hear me both of which are given special emphasis by the music take on added meaning After all it is the function of the artist to show his audience something and not simply to tell them about it And the artistic act is not complete until it is received until it is heard It may help to remember that Rain was originally released as the B side of a single with Paperback Writer on the A side This context is significant since Paperback Writer is a song that is literally about an artist in this case an author trying to get published So it makes sense that both sides of the single are about artistic expression I like to think of this song as a wonderful sort of summary of The Beatles lives their most basic attitudes towards life and of their art When John Paul and George first started making music together they were three kids from Liverpool who couldn t win a talent show This didn t deter them They spent the better part of two years playing music in a sleazy part of Hamburg making little money living in squalor surrounded by people who couldn t speak their language This didn t faze them They spent months trying to get a recording contract in England and were turned down by every major record label They kept playing music They became the top act in the music business on both sides of the Atlantic with most people in the industry still considering them another flash in the pan that no one would remember in another three months They kept writing and recording songs Their life became one long tour playing in front of crowds screaming so loudly that they couldn t hear themselves play They took this in stride And so it goes So when John sings Rain I don t mind and Shine the weather s fine there are years of experience compressed into those few words When you look back at the career of The Beatles and the amazing run they had you have to wonder how they made it how they stayed focused how they avoided any of the pitfalls The answer for me is in this song Implicit in these lyrics is a wonderful sort of constancy a remarkable and single minded focus No matter what the rest of the world thought of them and no matter how crazy their situation became they remained focused on what had originally brought them together a love for this new kind of music and a desire to create more of it Beatles 2000 The Beatles The Beatles Anthology Chronicle Books 2000"

        content: "This is a gem of a Dylan song not a big gaudy rock but a modest yet finely wrought masterpiece It was released in 1989 on his album Oh Mercy so it s not from any of his early years during which his work was more consistently revered The album was produced by Daniel Lanois and critics are somewhat divided over the success of his efforts in rendering Dylan s voice and compositions I find the original version by Dylan to be pretty underwhelming but the song came alive for me when I heard it performed by Sarah Jarosz She recorded it on her second album Follow Me Down from 2011 and she s included it consistently in the several live shows of hers that I ve seen For me the Dylan version seems a bit slow and somnolent while the Jarosz version feels much more spirited Partly I suppose it s the difference between the performance of a world weary man approaching the half century mark working on his 26th album versus a youthful 20 year old working on her second But it s also that Jarosz is both a fine singer and instrumentalist and she brings some additional verve to both the singing and the playing But give one or both versions a listen or view this rendition on YouTube

St Peter > Where the four winds blow > Ring them bells with an iron hand > So the people will know > Oh it s rush hour now > On the wheel and the plow > And the sun is going down > Upon the sacred cow > > Ring them bells Sweet Martha > For the poor man s son > Ring them bells so the world will know > That God is one > Oh the shepherd is asleep > Where the willows weep > And the mountains are filled > With lost sheep > > Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf > Ring them bells for all of us who are left > Ring them bells for the chosen few > Who will judge the many when the game is through > Ring them bells for the time that flies > For the child that cries > When innocence dies > > Ring them bells St Catherine > From the top of the room > Ring them from the fortress > For the lilies that bloom > Oh the lines are long > And the fighting is strong > And they re breaking down the distance > Between right and wrong One of the interesting things about this song is that unlike most Dylan songs and most songs in general there are no characters and there is no dramatic structure More than that the structure of the song is accumulative rather than linear additional details are filled in as the song continues but there is no sense of one thing leading to another ending in some sort of denouement This is one reason why the title of the song is not revealed in the chorus or in a final line but is used to start the song and then repeated frequently One might also see this as part of the usual structure for persuasive writing with the author opening their arguments by stating their thesis But even the details that Dylan accumulates for us are suggestive rather than specific The effect is to imply a universality to his message one not limited to any specific actor locale or situation So once all the brush strokes are filled in what do we have Well the lyrics include references to saints and to God and to heathens and to characters from the Christian Bible as well as to the ringing of bells often found in churches so one might be tempted to interpret the song as some sort of Christian proselytizing That would be a mistake though I think Recall what Dylan told an interviewer https www newsweek com dylan revisited 174056 in 1997 > Here s the thing with me and the religious thing This is the flat out truth I find the religiosity and philosophy in the music I don t find it anywhere else Songs like Let Me Rest on a Peaceful Mountain or I Saw the Light that s my religion I don t adhere to rabbis preachers evangelists all of that I ve learned more from the songs than I ve learned from any of this kind of entity The songs are my lexicon I believe the songs So in this song perhaps Dylan is trying to impart some sort of religious feeling and philosophy but without dragging along the entire weight of any particular religion or church or book or teacher Instead I believe he is using these images because they are a handy part of a shared cultural heritage but not necessarily indicators of any overall endorsement of Christianity So having dispensed with something that is not there what is there First one might ask to whom is the song addressed and where are the bells to be rung And the answers seem to be everyone and everywhere the heathens in the cities the recluses in the sanctuaries across the valleys and streams where the four winds blow from the top of the room and from the fortress And then one might ask for whom are we ringing the bells Well for the poor man s son for the lost sheep for the blind and the deaf for all of us who are left for the chosen few for the child that cries and for the lilies that bloom Again it s a lengthy and perhaps somewhat all inclusive list And now we come to what must be the central question what is being asked of us What is Dylan asking for when he commands us repeatedly to ring them bells Well we might observe that the ringing of church bells to call a community together is a practice dating back to at least the early Middle Ages And some similar means of calling members to prayer is present in almost all religions So here as in All Along the Watchtower Dylan is using ancient images and symbols that suggest he is talking about some common element of humanity that runs right through our history for at least a millennium And of course any ringing of bells is a very public call to action a call to a community to come together for some common purpose And what is this purpose Well to put things right To stand the world upright To make time run forward towards some goal To have the bride run towards a union instead of away from it To lift us all out of a frantic rush hour going back and forth between joyless labor and isolated homes To restore an empathy for those who are suffering and to take action to lessen that suffering To end the weeping To return our shepherds to their true calling of caring for their flocks To allow children and perhaps the rest of us to enjoy some sense of innocence To restore and preserve the distance between right and wrong In some sense of course this is a Christian message But I came across a quotation recently that seems informative in this context > The goal is not to bring people to Christianity the goal is to bring people to love If that s through Christianity fine It it s another religion or no religion at all fine What the world needs is love not more people professing right belief And so when Dylan asks us to ring them bells so the world will know that God is one I believe he is asking us to acknowledge and respect a universal moral code based on love and empathy for others not to worship in some particular church or pray to some particular god And so we have perhaps a sermon of sorts But the artistry of the song lies in its indirection in its patient and roundabout cataloging of supporting elements in its short and emphatic and repeated statement of its central thesis Another Dylan gem for the ages and a call for a more just and inclusive society"

of all time If I had written the rest of Reason To Rock https reasontorock com first and then created a song to illustrate everything I d been talking about https www reasontorock com elements overview html I couldn t have come up with a better example The track opens with a jangly electric guitar Drums and organ make a splashy entrance on top of the guitar and a saxophone is soon added to the mix They rise to a quick crescendo prefiguring the action to come then drop down into the basic riff that provides backing for the verses Springsteen s vocal starts His voice is warm relaxed earthy and assured almost swaggering He speaks his lines as much as sings them stretching syllables then shortening them playing with the beat The backing instruments are laid back but energetic and playful supporting the mood of the singer The sound is rich including guitar drums piano organ and saxophone all playing behind the vocal The rhythms are strong and propulsive with the whole effect being something like a coiled spring suggesting hidden power yet to be unleashed Here s what he sings > Spread out now Rosie Doctor come cut loose her mama s reins > You know playin blindman s bluff is a little baby s game > You pick up Little Dynamite I m gonna pick up Little Gun > And together we re gonna go out tonight and make that highway run The overt tension of the song is laid out in these first two couplets Springsteen wants to release the girl from her parents so that she can be with the singer Rosie s parents and their house are part of what constrains her but the mention of a childhood game also suggests that Rosie herself is not sure she is ready to leave her girlhood behind and become a young woman Notice the dramatic movement in the beginning of this first verse The first two lines describe the current state of the girl childish and still tied to her mother s apron strings The next two lines introduce two friends whose nicknames suggest explosive and perhaps dangerous freedom and the intention of the singer to release the girl from her bondage Note also the marvelous language that Springsteen uses Here as throughout the song he manages to choose words that work simultaneously at two different levels On the one hand they sound conversational and vernacular as if this were a straightforward and everyday conversation between a guy and a girl At the same time though many of the words are symbolic and the phrasing unusual The overall effect is of a wonderful kind of street poetry The names of some of their friends such as Dynamite and Little Gun work in this way The last line quoted above is also a wonderful example of these parallel meanings The sentence starts out saying we re gonna go out tonight using an altogether ordinary phrase But then the same line finishes with the promise and make that highway run If the word run is interpreted as a noun then this phrase is also ordinary although there is a hint of mystery since we don t know what that highway run consists of or where it leads But the phrase could also be interpreted to mean force the highway to run a sense that has no literal meaning but has wonderful symbolic resonance Another interesting element of the song is the relatively long line length This results in many of the lines being broken in the middle really containing two sentences or a compound sentence The effect of this device is to convey the singer s confidence and informality unlike many singers he s not in a hurry to neatly finish off each couplet by supplying the closing rhyme instead he stretches each line out confident we will wait around for the pay off Let s see how Springsteen closes out the verse > You don t have to call me lieutenant Rosie and I don t want to be > your son > The only lover I m ever gonna need s your soft sweet little girl s > tongue > Rosie you re the one These three lines are wonderfully rich It s important to remember that by the time this song was released in 1973 tales of urban romance teen love and liberation from parents already had a pretty full tradition These lines though make it clear that Springsteen is staking out his own territory The first line implies that Springsteen is not looking for a traditional patriarchal relationship of male dominance and female submission he doesn t plan on giving her orders or on calling her his mama The next line is wonderfully sensual going beyond the bounds of traditional propriety in pop and rock songs And the last line in its elegant simplicity says that he is not merely interested in playing around with her or in another sexual exploit So while the overt conflict in the song is in freeing Rosie from her parents there are other sorts of liberation at work here too Underneath the lyrics the music is doing interesting things as well The urgency of the rhythms build beneath the first line above The song then slows for thoughtful reflection behind the second line emphasizing the intimacy of the words The drums and sax then soar again when we hit the climactic exclamation Rosie you re the one carrying us along into the second verse > Dynamite s in the belfry playin with the bats > Little Gun s downtown in front of Woolworth s > tryin out his attitude on all the cats > Papa s on the corner waitin for the bus > Mama she s home in the window waitin up for us > She ll be there in that chair when they wrestle her upstairs > cause you know we ain t gonna come > I ain t here for business I m only here for fun > And Rosie you re the one The second verse continues in the vein established by the first with some interesting variations Some humor is added to the mix giving us a break from the urgency of the first verse The playful use of language continues including the wonderful declaration I ain t here for business I m only here for fun Line lengths now vary quite a bit again giving the singer a chance to play with rhythm and melody this time by stretching out one line and then racing through the next Some internal rhymes begin to show up such as chair and upstairs adding to the playfulness of the song Clarence Clemons sax soars gracefully behind the singer suggesting the release from parental controls into the fluid freedoms of youthful camaraderie Now for the first time we hit the wonderful chorus Springsteen is helped out on vocals by his band members singing backup embodying the youthful community he has been describing Clemons continues to soar on sax adding a suggestion of salsa as we find out Rosie s full name and discover her Hispanic heritage > Rosalita jump a little lighter > Se ntilde orita come sit by my fire > I just want to be your lover ain t no liar > Rosalita you re my stone desire The best part of the chorus is the first line Springsteen again makes it clear he is not attempting to liberate Rosie from one constraining relationship only to bind her to another one Has there ever been a more graceful liberating injunction between prospective lovers Rosalita jump a little lighter The saxophone continues beyond the words lightly climbing the scales embodying the release suggested by the lyrics The third verse again followed by the chorus names additional characters adding to the feeling of community that illuminates the song Springsteen also strengthens his injunction to Rosie to join him urging her to walk right out through the front door adding to the sense that he wants her psychological liberation as much as her physical escape > Jack the Rabbit and Weak Knees Willie you know they re gonna be > there > Ah sloppy Sue and Big Bones Billie they ll be comin up for air > We re gonna play some pool skip some school act real cool > stay out all night it s gonna feel all right > So Rosie come out tonight Baby come out tonight > > Windows are for cheaters chimneys for the poor > Closets are for hangers winners use the door > So use it Rosie that s what it s there for > > Rosalita jump a little lighter > Se ntilde orita come sit by my fire > I just want to be your lover ain t no liar > Rosalita you re my stone desire Springsteen now plays with the structure of the song We hear a sort of false ending an extended musical interlude that could easily have faded out with the song already at about the four minute mark But instead the music slows pauses then resumes slowly behind the singer as he speaks the following confessional > Now I know your mama she don t like me > cause I play in a rock and roll band > And I know your daddy he don t dig me > but he never did understand > Papa lowered the boom he locked you in your room > > I m comin to lend a hand > I m comin to liberate you confiscate you I want to be your man > Someday we ll look back on this and it will all seem funny Now the song begins to rev up again the band playing louder Springsteen s voice rising in intensity > But now you re sad your mama s mad > And your papa says he knows that I don t have any money > Oh your papa says he knows that I don t have any money > Oh so your daddy says he knows that I don t have any money These last three lines are sung with the band acting as chorus with only drums for backup and with hand claps emphasizing the rhythm The group almost sounds like a chain gang singing the same lines over and over again to provide rhythm for their physical labors The effect is certainly to suggest poverty and a lack of freedom But now the music explodes and the lyrics provide a sudden dramatic reversal > Tell him this is his last chance > To get his daughter in a fine romance > Because a record company Rosie just gave me a big advance Here for one shining moment the singer seems to have it all the usually adult attributes of money power and respect while still retaining his youth his community of peers his playful attitude and his love But the beginning of the next verse starts immediately comically deflating the image before it can become overstated > My tires were slashed and I almost crashed but the Lord had mercy > My machine she s a dud I m stuck in the mud > somewhere in the swamps of Jersey > Hold on tight stay up all night cause Rosie I m comin on strong > By the time we meet in the morning light I will hold you in my arms Now at the end of this verse we get a glimpse of real freedom of the promised land The music slows and the singer s reading is breathtakingly beautiful > I know a pretty little place in Southern California down San Diego > way > There s a little caf eacute where they play guitars all night and > day > You can hear them in the back room strummin > So hold tight baby cause don t you know daddy s comin > > Everybody sing > > Rosalita jump a little lighter > Se ntilde orita come sit by my fire > I just want to be your lover ain t no liar > Rosalita you re my stone desire We hit the chorus again and then the song comes to a big muscular finish the band playing for all it s worth shouting in the background finally winding down into a single echoing note on the organ This song has it all The lyrics are funny personal and idiosyncratic bringing you into touch with real people and real situations The song describes liberation from parents from traditional social structures from the boring world of adult toil and into authentic love community adventure and art The structure of the song is fluid and full of surprises liberating itself from traditional forms as it goes The playing of the band is strong and supple The instruments are as restless as the singer yet moving in perfect sympathy and synchronicity with him Together they perform as one cohesive unit yet with room for all the individual parts and allowing them all full freedom of expression This is rock music at its best Originally

        summary: "<p>In this song, Berry recounts the events of a typical day in school. </p>", 
        content: "In this song Berry recounts the events of a typical day in school The first verse gets the protagonist out of bed and into class and manages to summarize the tension of working for good grades and competing with peers > Up in the morning and out to school > The teacher is teaching the Golden Rule > American History and Practical Math > You re studying hard and hoping to pass > Working your fingers right down to the bone > And the guy behind you won t leave you alone The second verse goes on to describe the rushed crowded experience of the lunchroom followed by more classes in the afternoon > Ring ring goes the bell > The cook in the lunchroom s ready to sell > You re lucky if you can find a seat > You re fortunate if you have time to eat > Back in the classroom open your books > Gee but the teacher don t know how mean she looks Drop the coin right into the slot You gotta hear something that s really hot With the one you love you re makin romance All day long you been wanting to dance Feelin the music from head to toe Round and round and round you go Drop the coin right into the slot You gotta hear something that s really hot With the one you love you re makin romance All day long you been wanting to dance Feelin the music from head to toe Round and round and round you go The third verse finally provides release getting our hero out of school and down the street into the local juke joint > Soon as three o clock rolls around > You finally lay your burden down > Close up your books get out of your seat > Down the halls and into the street > Up to the corner and round the bend > Right to the juke joint you go in The fourth verse describes the experience of listening and dancing to the rock and roll available from the juke box > Drop the coin right into the slot > You gotta hear something that s really hot > With the one you love you re makin romance > All day long you been wanting to dance > Feelin the music from head to toe > Round and round and round you go The instrumental break that follows features Berry s lead guitar which serves to dramatize the scene just described The fifth and final verse explicitly describes the liberating power of rock music > Hail hail rock and roll > Deliver me from the days of old > Long live rock and roll > The beat of the drums loud and bold > Rock rock rock and roll > The feeling is there body and soul This songs works on a number of different levels all complementary First it offers a slice of American teenage life in the late fifties A wealth of detailed observation serves the song well in this regard the sharp glimpses of the school day the movement down the halls and into the street the local juke joint where you could select your favorite tunes and dance to them with your best girl all these and more are carefully depicted The song also works as a direct expression of rock s grand theme of liberation The first two verses describe the oppression of the school day being subject to authority working hard at the study of subjects that seem to have no intrinsic interest the regimented schedule of classes with no more than a brief interlude for lunch the competition with the jostling crowd at the school The next two verses offer release from all these constraints Soon as three o clock rolls around you finally lay your burden down The scene at the juke joint is joyful and energetic in stark contrast to the school day In particular there is contrast between the rigid structure of the school routine and the emotional freedom offered by the rock music and its associated environment hearing something really hot feeling the music from head to toe and making romance with the one you love Finally the song pays direct homage to rock music as a liberating force saying that by being loud and bold the music can deliver us from the days of old And what are we being liberated to The feeling is there body and soul So we can see that this brief rock song encapsulates the mission of rock music as a liberating force freeing a generation from a value system that places structure discipline and rote learning at the top of its pyramid and releasing it to a new world dominated by passion and feeling Put another way the movement is from an experience based primarily on the head to a whole body experience that includes the heart and soul as well as the mind I ve focused on the lyrics so far but the music is just as good and entirely supports the themes conveyed by the words Berry s guitar opens the song repeating the same chord as rapidly as a jack hammer or the sound of an alarm going off Then he delivers the first line with a swooping note sliding upwards perfectly paralleling the movement of the words U u up in the morning and out to school To fully appreciate the first line of the song you need to compare it to the first line of the last verse Hail hail rock and roll Note that for ostensibly the same melody you have only five syllables in the last verse and a total of nine in the first This is not just a matter of convenience or sloppiness the crowded syllables in the first verse perfectly represent the hectic day at school while the clean and graceful melody of the last verse represents the unfettered freedom offered by rock music Another way to appreciate the magnitude of Berry s musical achievement in this song is to try to imagine Frank Sinatra singing its first line U u up in the morning and out to school The image simply doesn t work This is some indication that Berry really has delivered us from the days of old There is an entirely new musical sensibility at work here In place of the subtle melodies and lilting swing of the past generation we have the staccato percussive attack of rock n roll expressed through Berry s guitar as well as his vocals The structure of the song is worth mention as well There is no repeated chorus at the end of each verse Berry easily sacrifices this pop convention seemingly in order to make room for a couple of extra verses Neither is there a bridge Both of these mechanisms usually are employed to add melodic novelty in order to keep the listener s interest and to prevent the repetitive structure of the verses from becoming too monotonous But Berry has no need of these devices here First the lyrics are simply too good and the movement of the song too strong for the effort to become boring But more to the point musically Berry subtly varies the melody from verse to verse adding extra syllables at time as already noted He also uses his guitar to echo and comment on each vocal line and the variations here are more than enough to hold the listener s interest In place of the bridge he has an instrumental break featuring his guitar Given the theme of the song Berry s rocking guitar solo works perfectly setting words to action and playing something really hot letting the listener feel the music in addition to understanding the words It is impossible to overstate Berry s achievement on this recording In retrospect many components of early rock and roll and indeed of all popular art seem to consist of historical happenstance and cultural artifacts Musical style A meets style B and style C is produced Fleeting hair and clothing styles are immortalized in song The music seems to be a product of its time and place rather than of an individual artist or group of particular individuals Imagine for a moment that we could separate this one recording from its cultural and economic surroundings Take away Buddy Holly Elvis Presley and all the rest Erase the fact of this song s success on the Top Ten Forget bobby sox tight jeans and blue suede shoes Even if all we had was this one recording of Chuck Berry s we would have ample evidence of art and artist Look deeply at this one track and you find an act of conscious creation expressing a unique artistic vision belonging to a particular individual As Berry said in another song Roll over Beethoven and tell Tchaikovsky the news"

        content: "A couple of things that happened recently got me cogitating on the idea of language as playground First I had a chance to hear Anne Curzan https acurzan english lsa umich edu speak Curzan is the talented and engaging dean of the College of Literature Science and the Arts at the University of Michigan my alma mater and is also a linguist who studies the history of the English language Her bio states that she aims to promote a culture based in purpose and contributing to the common good the power of learning the value of play emphasis mine and the importance of well being Well I m here to tell you any time you stir together the value of play and the study of the English language in the same pitcher you re mixing up a cocktail that I will happily imbibe Now I m disappointed to have to report that my usual reference source has a rather dry and unsatisfactory definition of the word play suggesting that the word means only to engage in activity for enjoyment and recreation rather than a serious or practical purpose But it takes no more than a cursory review of a text such as Wonderland How Play Made the Modern World https www penguinrandomhouse com books 533949 wonderland by steven johnson to see the meaning of the word begin to unfold in a much more interesting way For me the term means something like to fashion something new or novel in an uninhibited manner initially motivated only by the pure joy of creative experimentation And as a lifelong reader and English major myself playing with language is something that has fascinated me for my entire life There are so many possibilities different words different combinations different structures different ways that the words interact with one another different images that those words conjure up And once you begin to speak as well as write and sing as well as speak the possibilities expand even further I was reminded of this field of play again this week while listening to Delbert McClinton s latest album Outdated Emotion https music apple com us album outdated emotion 1608261734 The work consists primarily of covers of material that Delbert learned to love while growing up and I was already familiar with many of them but one in particular caught my ear called Setting The Woods on Fire It turns out that the song was originally recorded in 1952 by Hank Williams and written by Fred Rose and Ed G Nelson It was a hit for Hank and has been recorded by others since then so you may already be familiar with it but it was new to me Here are the lyrics but I recommend you listen to the recording https music apple com us album settin the woods on fire 1608261734 i=1608261743 as well not only to enjoy the music but also to hear how Delbert delivers the words > Comb your hair and paint and powder > You sing loud and I ll sing louder > You be proud and I ll be prouder > Tonight we re settin the woods on fire > > You re my gal and I m your feller > Dress up in your frock of yeller > I ll look swell but you ll look sweller > Settin the woods on fire > > We ll take in all the honky tonks > Tonight we re having fun > We ll show the folks a brand new dance > That never has been done > > I don t care who thinks we re silly > You be daffy and I ll be dilly > We ll order up two bowls of chili > Settin the woods on fire > > I ll gas up my hot rod stoker > We ll get hotter than a poker > You ll be broke but I ll be broker > Tonight we re settin the woods on fire > > We ll sit close to one another > Up one street and down the other > We ll have us a time oh brother > Settin the woods on fire > > We ll put aside a little time > To fix a flat or two > My tires and tubes are doin fine > But the air is showin through > > You clap hands and I ll start bowin > We ll do all the law s allowin > Tomorrow I ll be right back plowin > Settin the woods on fire Boy so much play going on here where do I start First of course there s the title and refrain Settin the Woods on Fire an invented expression that brings up images of working and playing hard in a rural setting using an entertaining and imaginative turn of phrase Then there s the usage of the words daffy and dilly likely influenced by the Daffy Dilly https en wikipedia org wiki Daffy Dilly cartoon about Daffy Duck released in 1948 Then there are the explicit references to play that somehow manage to include all the elements of the definition I offered above + fashioning something new or novel > We ll show the folks a brand new dance that never has been done + in an uninhibited manner > I don t care who thinks we re silly + motivated by pure joy > Tonight we re having fun Then there s all the wordplay within the lyrics + Interesting rhymes such as silly dilly chili + Fun word variants such as sweller broker and stoker + Intriguing juxtaposition of imagery such as the ways that the notion of heat is invoked starting with the title but then carried through with the promise that We ll get hotter than a poker And then there are all the anachronisms within the song which I appreciate as ties to an earlier time which is just out of my reach of experience but brought within the reach of my understanding by the lyrics and style of the song and helps me to better understand my own parents now deceased but not forgotten But your reaction to all this may well be + So what + Who cares about such things + What is being accomplished here To which I would first respond by quoting one of my favorite although lamentably fictional English professors Gervase Fen https en wikipedia org wiki Gervase Fen as recounted in Edmund Crispin s novel The Case of the Gilded Fly > Fen sighed We are all becoming standardized and normal Nigel The divine gift of purely nonsensical speech and action is in atrophy Would you believe it A pupil of mine had the impertinence the other day to tick me off for reading him passages regarding the Fimble Fowl and the Quangle Wangle https www poetryfoundation org poems 44604 the quangle wangles hat as an illustration of pure poetic inventiveness I put him in his place all right In the semi darkness his eye became momentarily lambent with remembered satisfaction But there s no eccentricity nowadays none at all And then should Fen s answer not suffice I would again refer the reader to Steven Johnson s treatise https bookshop org books wonderland how play made the modern world 9780399184499 explaining how play is such a powerful force in our world for although the initial motivation for creative play may be pure joy such activity often generates useful inventions that can enrich the lives of all of us And then finally I would remind the reader that language is the best vessel we have for containing and conveying important ideas and that a useful diversity of thought as well as a rich understanding of the human experience cannot be achieved and sustained if we limit ourselves to an impoverished language made up only of common and obviously utilitarian elements We humans have been playing with language ever since we contrived ways of speaking to one another and the fruits of this play have arguably made possible our entire pageant of human history Why stop now The worst that can happen is that we ll have a little fun"

        content: "This is a traditional Appalachian folk song believed to have originated in eastern Kentucky around the beginning of the 20th century The melody seems to have come from the ballad Matty Groves and probably started out in England or Scotland If you re a child of the sixties like me then your introduction to the song may have come though the electrified adaptation by Quicksilver Messenger Service but it is more typically performed in acoustic folk country or bluegrass styles One of the features that draws me to this song is its elusive shape shifting nature As in a dream very specific concrete images appear and then are replaced with others leaving the singer listener dreamer free to choose the meanings they associate with these word pictures This elusive quality begins with the title itself which sounds like the name or description of a place and yet is often used in the song as if it were the name of a woman This ambiguity is captured in the cover art for the Quicksilver Messenger Service album showing a woman seated in a grove beneath the shade of a tree Is it the woman or the place we are singing of Or perhaps some dreamlike combination of the two with the memory of a woman and our feelings for her forever rooted in a particular time and place This variability is extended with the chorus of the song which has at least three common variants > Shady Grove my little love > Shady Grove my darling > Shady Grove my little love > I m going back to Harlan The place to which the singer is returning in this variant is Harlan Kentucky https en wikipedia org wiki Harlan Kentucky But is this also the location of Shady Grove or someplace different > Shady Grove my little love > Shady Grove I say > Shady Grove my little love > I m bound to go away In this version the singer is more definitely planning to leave Shady Grove for some other destination > Shady Grove my little love > Shady Grove I know > Shady Grove my little love > I m bound for Shady Grove And in this version the singer is definitely headed to Shady Grove So how do we resolve these differences Are these variants in conflict with one another For me they are not because the emotional sense of the song seems to include all of these these feelings of having to leave to make one s way in the world but carrying with us this image of some pure love some perfect lover forever framed in an idyllic scene some place to which we long to return Does this place actually exist in time and space Or is it something we carry with us in our heart our mind perhaps our soul There is no need to provide definitive answers to these questions because the song is precisely about these tensions and not about their resolution So let s now turn to some of the verses that are commonly sung again among many possible variants > Peaches in the summertime > Apples in the fall > If I can t have the girl I love > I don t want none at all Note how this verse presents us with very concrete images Also note that it alludes to the passage of time Yet it also suggests the sweetness of fruit when captured at its peak ripeness And then it extends that association to the girl the singer loves suggesting perhaps a memory of her in her youth but also suggesting that she may in some timeless fashion be the best that womanhood has to offer this man Again all of these possible meanings are present in the words in the music in the singer s voice and we get to feel all of them along with some sense of who the singer must be to embody all of these images and feelings Here is another verse with images from nature > Cheeks as red as a blooming rose > Eyes are the prettiest brown > She s the darling of my heart > She ll stay til the sun goes down And another one referring to the sweetness of Shady Grove s kisses as well as affirming her uniqueness among her peers > A kiss from pretty little Shady Grove > As sweet as brandy wine > And there ain t no girl in this whole world > That s prettier than mine This next verse presents a lovely bucolic innocent youthful portrait of the singer s beloved > I went to see my Shady Grove > She was standing in the door > Her shoes and stockings in her hand > And her little bare feet on the floor And this next one again makes reference to youth > When I was a little boy > I wanted a Barlow knife > And now I want little Shady Grove > To say she ll be my wife A Barlow knife was a style of folding pocket knife invented in England but popular in the US in the 18th and 19th centuries There are several verses starting with I wish This first one suggests that the singer might go away and return on a regular basis > I wish I had a big fine horse > And corn to feed him on > Then Shady Grove would stay at home > And feed him when I m gone This next one is more fanciful > I wish I had a banjo string > Made of golden twine > And every tune I d play on it > I d wish that girl was mine As is this one > I wish I had a needle and thread > As fine as I could sew > I d sew that girl to my side > And down the road I d go This next one refers to music making and dancing and makes it clear that the singer s intentions are more serious than those of others > Some come here to fiddle and dance > Some come here to tarry > Some come here to fiddle and dance > I come here to marry Then there s this last verse which when present seems to always come at the end of the performance since its tone is less suggestive of hopeful innocence than the rest > Every night when I go home > My wife I try to please her > The more I try the worse she gets > Damned if I won t leave her There are many worthy renditions of the song almost all of them with something special to offer the listener The recording I m featuring here is one from Masontown http www masontownmusic com that I particularly enjoy"

        content: "I ve been a Jesse Winchester https www allmusic com artist jesse winchester mn0000339905 fan ever since I slipped his first album onto my turntable in my dorm room back in Ann Arbor but somehow I don t think I d paid much attention to this gem until I stumbled across it yesterday This fits neatly into Winchester s small but accomplished set of songs about god and religion songs like Quiet About It and Isn t That So One of the things I love about this group of Winchester songs is that he displays obvious familiarity with and even sympathy for the Christian tradition but manages to bring an entirely fresh approach to his questioning of these sacred topics This song seems to start with the picture painted by the spiritual When The Saints Go Marching In https en wikipedia org wiki When the Saints Go Marching In and then picks up from there Give a listen to the Winchester recording then stroll with me through the lyrics > Step by step > All the happy Saints go marching in These first two lines set the scene for us and provide some linkage to the traditional spiritual > And if those Saints step out of line > They ll have to start again Now Winchester begins to introduce a sly questioning of what might happen to a saint who slips from grace before making it to heaven Notice how he s now introducing some imagery and notions probably more part of contemporary life than anything found in the Bible things like waiting in line stepping out of line and being told to go to the back of the line > Cause Jacob s golden ladder > Get s slippery at the top Again Winchester is artfully and comically mixing authentic Biblical references with modern imagery Jacob s ladder https en wikipedia org wiki Jacob 27s Ladder is a straight lift from the book of Genesis but the image of it getting slippery at the top seems taken from a slapstick comedy > And many a happy go lucky saint > Has made that long long drop And with these final two lines from this first verse Winchester completes this initial scene His tone here is pitch perfect If one wants to read this as a sad contemporary recounting of our tendency to slip from God s grace then this is perfectly defensible At the same time the image of that long long drop strikes me as a bit cartoonish bringing up memories of Wile E Coyote https en wikipedia org wiki Wile E Coyote and the Road Runner chasing the Road Runner over a cliff and then comically plunging to his destruction And now comes the chorus which provides a sort of reaction shot from Winchester to the scene we ve just witnessed > If I m late don t wait > Go on without me > I may tarry awhile Here Winchester makes his decision clear He s not in any hurry to climb that ladder even though he s happy to send his companions along in their ascent I especially like his use of the refined and somewhat dated word tarry with its intentionally indefinite specification of how long the singer might linger before joining his companions And why is Winchester choosing to fall behind > Cause I need to know > Before I go > How come the Devil smiles Here in only three lines Winchester manages to evoke a tension central to the Christian Bible this idea of the forbidden fruit growing on the tree of the knowledge of good and evil And so rather than ascending to heaven with the happy go lucky and perhaps blissfully ignorant saints he stays behind in pursuit of forbidden knowledge And now Winchester continues his depiction of heavenly glory with a second verse > Free from care free from sin > The Saints are trooping in > The children play all around the throne > Innocent of sin > A trillion voices sing the name > The mortal may not know > And Heaven s walls are too high to hear > The trouble down below Here Winchester paints a picture of heaven filled with the ascendant souls now completely removed from earthly cares and absorbed in their worship of the supreme deity But again some contemporary phrases are mixed in to suggest a different perspective with the saints trooping in and a trillion voices singing But then he finishes the scene by pointing out there is still plenty of trouble down on earth where the singer still resides and the studied avoidance of these earthly cares now seems to be something less than saintly The unasked but clearly implied question might be what s the use of these saints if they can t lend a hand with what s going on down on Earth And now we have the chorus repeated > If I m late don t wait > Go on without me > I may tarry awhile > Cause I need to know > Before I go > How come the Devil smiles And now let me talk a bit about the music which is extraordinary The song unfolds to a heavy marching beat suggestive of the New Orleans roots of the song The Saints Go Marching In But instead of Louis Armstrong blowing his jubilation through his trumpet we have Paul Butterfield blowing the blues on his harmonica alternately suggesting the tortured screams of those trapped in the trouble down below and then the sweet visage of the devil s smile And there we have it The entire track clocks in at just under three minutes One can certainly view the song as a serious warning about avoiding the temptations of the devil But for me it s a more complex picture that Winchester paints He seems to be suggesting that these sunday school depictions of the saints marching up to heaven are in fact cartoonish and too simplistic to be taken seriously as perhaps are the traditional sunday school notions of good and evil And that perhaps unraveling the mystery of the devil s smile and wrestling with those troubles down below are more ambitious and worthy tasks than trying to trod a path that stays as far away from sin as possible Winchester s entire body of work suggests that he was more interested in the complex problems faced by us humans down here on earth than he was in gaining quick entry into heaven And it may help us to know that Winchester chose to flee to Canada rather than fight in the VietNam war and was only able to return to his native land once Carter granted pardons in 1977 to all of those who made similar decisions during that conflict Did the devil smile to see Winchester evade his military duty Or would he have smiled to see Winchester killing North Vietnamese as part of the US military effort in that part of the world Such complex moral judgments are part and parcel of life on Earth but don t seem to enter into any simplistic pictures of the saints trooping up Jacob s ladder Winchester tarried down here long enough for me to see him perform a masterful solo set at The Triple Door here in Seattle a few years ago and I ll be forever grateful for that chance to have seen him in person before he left us As for where he is now I ll be content to envision him occupying a suite somewhere close by Leonard Cohen s in the Tower of Song https en wikipedia org wiki Tower of Song He s certainly earned a spot there"

        content: "This song by Jess Chambers won the Best New Zealand Country Song award in 2009 so even though Jess is my niece I have no reservations in recommending it I don t know that Jess would ever describe herself as a country singer but she certainly had a chance to hear some country tunes while growing up in Southern California close to her American grandfather I can t help but think that Jess had her tongue at least a little bit in cheek when writing these lyrics although it s clearly in a different position when she s singing them describing as she does a woman attracted to a man who has so little interest in her This YouTube video https youtu be z5xqWoPVZR4 nicely captures the spirit of the sessions that produced the album on which the song is featured Even though the lyrics are relatively simple there s a definite art to them the way the rhymes come and go reflect both the casual attitude of the singer as well as the irregular push and pull occurring between the two characters of the song > Baby you know that I love you > But you don t seem to care > Whether I m here or there > You treat me mean > And keep me keen > Just pulling me along on a string > > You just keep stringing me along > You just keep stringing me along > And I would rather be strung along > Than never see you at all > You re so mean to me > But I d rather be > At your beck and call > Than never hear from you at all > > I know you know that I m your type of gal > We could be together so naturally > But you so easily forget > I would be your pet > If you would show me some loving > > You just keep stringing me along > You just keep stringing me along > And I would rather be strung along > Than never see you at all > You re so mean to me > But I d rather be > At your beck and call > Than never hear from you at all > > Now sugar you know that I think you re hot stuff > But you keep telling me that I m not cool enough > Oh but I m trying to maintain > Yeah I m painting my face > Making sure my hair s in place > > You just keep stringing me along > You just keep stringing me along > And I would rather be strung along > Than never see you at all > You re so mean to me > But I d rather be > At your beck and call > Than never hear from you at all > > I would rather be strung along > Oh I would rather be at your beck and call > Than to never ever see you at all Even if Jess is my niece I just have to say how much I love this recording of hers It s such an offbeat sort of lyric complaining about how poorly she s being treated by her lover yet at the same time being open about how she s still attracted and attached to him combined with such a sweet bouncy infectious little melody that as a listener I found myself drawn into the singer s world happily singing along even though the words I m singing seem to describe a situation I should be upset about The recording as part of the Woolshed sessions is a perfect match for the song Jess voice is just right sweetly innocent sounding low key letting the music carry her along then breaking free towards the end The guitars are just enough to complement the singer s voice without overpowering or drawing too much attention to themselves And the backup singers on the chorus provide a perfect framing device sounding like a supportive band of friends who are standing with her preventing the whole mood from becoming too maudlin and self pitying I love the video as well a combination of still pictures taken of Jess and the rest of the musicians during the sessions Like the backup singers these pictures frame the singer s story inside the larger story of the singer s telling of the tale and put some distance between the subject of the song and the singer s current emotional state All in all I find the whole thing an irresistible little package"

        content: "The first thing to be said about this track is how utterly different it is from most rock songs In a field where compositions are most often about sexual or romantic relationships with a significant minority about the music itself or about philosophy we have here a first person narrative from Beelzebub Lyrically and thematically the song is in a class by itself Similarly the instrumentation is rather odd for a rock song Percussion is provided by what sounds like a combination of snare drum conga drums and maracas The steady 4 4 backbeat for which rock is famous propelled on by bass drum is replaced by a more complex samba rhythm So far as I can tell there is no rhythm guitar on the track Instead we have electric bass and piano the latter courtesy of famed session man Nicky Hopkins propelling the song along and defining its chord structure The bass guitar is featured prominently taking on something of the role normally played by rhythm guitar perhaps because it is played by normal lead guitarist Keith Richards rather than the Stones usual bass player Bill Wyman Di Perna 2002 Another unusual element of the song is the way it evolves and progresses over its course In general rock songs tend to repeat the same instrumental accompaniment from one verse to the next In this song though there is a definite progression with additional instruments and vocals being added to successive verses More about this later Let s consider the lyrics next What are they all about If you take them at face value you might consider that Mick Jagger as lead vocalist and lyricist is sincerely suggesting that the devil really isn t such a bad fellow After all he says every cop is a criminal and all the sinners saints and it was you and me who killed the Kennedys So what s the difference We re all the same aren t we He s just one of the lads Look more deeply though and you will find that this confusion of good and evil of appearance and reality is really just a ploy of the evil one The devil may appear to be a gentleman a man of wealth and taste He may appear to be polite and a member of good society approaching you with the words Let me please introduce myself and pleased to meet you But alongside of this we have a long catalog of some of the worst atrocities of human history starting with the torture of Christ on the cross and ending with the modern assassination of the Kennedys so contemporary in fact that the lyrics were changed from John Kennedy to the Kennedys while the Stones were in the studio recording the song Along the way we have the Crusades and the Bolshevik revolution in Russia thrown in for good measure So let there be no mistake there really is evil in the world This then is the real significance of the taunting refrain Hope you guess my name But what s puzzling you is the nature of my game This is not Mick Jagger saying hope you can guess that I m playing the devil in this song That s obvious from the beginning No this is the devil saying Hope you recognize me when you see me because I come in many guises And my game is not to do evil myself but to trick you into doing it This confusion between appearance and reality between good and evil runs throughout the song Christ is mentioned not only for the pain that he experienced but for his moment of doubt And in addition to all the acts of violence described the devil says that he has stolen many a man s soul and faith His interest in the son of God was not limited to the torture of Christ himself he also made damn sure that Pilate washed his hands and sealed his fate And his final threat to the listener is to lay your soul to waste Just in case we might be in danger of taking Jagger s appropriation of the devil as a serious case of religious conviction he throws in the lines I watched with glee while your kings and queens fought for ten decades for the gods they made So Jagger is not seriously arguing Christian doctrine here Instead Jagger seems to be using the devil as a symbol a personification of evil and of how it works in the world What the words seem to be saying is that there is evil in the world and we need to be on our guard because evil will not always appear as such and may often be disguised by those who would wish to deceive us So now that we ve got a fix on the words let s examine the music and see how it expands and reinforces the meaning of the song The track opens with an unusual beat pounded out on one drum What sound like congas then enter the mix adding accents on the final beats of the repeated line Maracas follow Together they make up what sounds like a jungle beat Jagger howls in the background his voice altered electronically to sound more bestial and echoing in the distance adding to the threatening impression of being in a dark jungle The howls are followed by grunts now sounding human but primitive The beat continues but the piano now enters with a slow stately series of chords Jagger appears on top of this with his most refined British accent half speaking half singing Please allow me to introduce myself I m a man of wealth and taste So we immediately have a jarring clash in perceptions are we in a jungle or a stately English manor What is real and what is illusion Jagger makes it through the first four lines before the propulsive bass starts building on the percussive mix still continuing in the background The effect is to pick up the pace to add a driving menace to the song The bass is not used to play a repetitive riff Instead it improvises relentlessly giving the impression of a prowling danger lurking just beneath the surface of Jagger s refined appearance We make it through the first verse and chorus with Hopkins still framing chords on the piano at a measured even pace But now as the bass kicks off the second verse Hopkins joins the fray playing faster improvising and picking up the underlying rhythm of the percussion instruments The music perfectly mirrors the anarchy portrayed in Jagger s lyrics as he describes the overthrow of the tzars and the blitzkrieg At the same time Jagger s voice becomes less controlled singing shouting now although still showing perfect enunciation on words like stank On the third verse we pick up background vocals singing high pitched whoo whoo s at the end of each line The vocals are almost childishly simple yet effective adding a ghost like refrain to the continuing rhythmic churning of the instruments Jagger s vocals are strained now cracking with emotion on nearly every word Keith Richards takes the fourth verse playing a brilliant slippery snake like guitar solo Never quite on the beat sliding from note to note producing a quick run of stinging notes one second then a single note held for several beats in the next Richards guitar is the perfect musical representation of Jagger s character in the song unpredictable anarchic elusive shape shifting After the solo we hear Jagger return for the usual chorus This is followed by a closing verse and chorus finishing off the tale told by the words But now the lid is completely taken off the instrumental mix percussion bass piano lead guitar and vocals jam on improvising continuously Richards guitar and Jaggers vocals play off of one another echoing slyly mimicking each other Jagger begins singing fragments from the song in a scratchy falsetto Chaos reigns with Jagger repeatedly taunting Can you guess my name Finally the song fades its activity not ended but seemingly just continuing at a greater distance moving to another town another audience Producer Jimmy Miller certainly deserves a lot of credit for this track providing the vessel that holds the volatile mixture together the unseen hand keeping the necessary order in the background so that apparent anarchy can rule in the foreground Nicky Hopkins and the percussion players add to the brew keeping the pot boiling always seemingly on the verge of spilling out of control Jagger has sometimes become known as a poseur acting jaded and decadent for the sheer amusement of it here though his artifice certainly serves a higher aesthetic purpose All in all this is a brilliant unique track Di Perna 2002 Di Perna Alan Oct 2002 Heart of Stone Guitar World New York Stanley R Harris"

watching if you like quirky as I generally do but it was the song that stuck with me This was really my introduction to the songs of George and Ira Gershwin with George supplying the music and brother Ira providing the lyrics Many of their songs have become recognized as part of the Great American Songbook https en wikipedia org wiki Great American Songbook but Ira s lyrics are often too subtle and offbeat to fit cleanly into that mold This song in particular is one that is less frequently sung Supposedly playwright and producer George S Kaufman heard an early rehearsal of the number and wondered whether it was in fact a love song at all before the brothers finally got to the lyric They laughed at me wanting you at which point Kaufman threw up his hands and said Oh well So if you re looking for straightforward love songs this is not the first one you d pick The rendition used in the Bogdanovich film was sung by Frank Sinatra and it s hard to go wrong Old Blue Eyes and Gershwin But Tony Bennett made an album in 1993 that featured songs originally sung by Fred Astaire and I ve always liked his recording But the Ella Fitzgerald rendition is probably as close to a perfect reference version as we can get so for my money I would recommend you start there So let s dive in The song starts with a brief intro more spoken than sung that is often omitted from modern recordings > The odds were a hundred to one against me > The world thought the heights were too high to climb > But people from Missouri never incensed me > Oh I wasn t a bit concerned > For from history I had learned > How many many times the worm had turned For those who may not immediately grasp the reference to people from Missouri they have long been known as the Show me state https www sos mo gov archives history slogan asp slow to believe a novel proposition until its truth has been clearly demonstrated What I like about the intro is the way Gershwin sets the stage for the lyrics to come comparing his amorous pursuit to some of the great feats achieved by humanity > They all laughed at Christopher Columbus > When he said the world was round > They all laughed when > Edison recorded sound > They all laughed at Wilbur and his brother > When they said that man could fly > They told Marconi > Wireless was a phony > It s the same old cry Now part of the fun here is that although Gershwin ends up talking about himself only in terms of a love affair it is obvious to anyone listening that he is also being wildly inventive with the song itself Consider the creative incorporation of the names and achievements of such a wide range of adventurers and inventors and the way he plays with the line length and rhyming scheme And in fact the Gershwin brothers https gershwin com the gershwin brothers contributed to the creation of the American musical as a sophisticated art form So while Ira may have been too modest to call direct attention to his and his brother s achievements he s certainly not above demonstrating his own inventiveness and thereby indirectly including himself in this list of notable inventors So now the part about love comes in > They laughed at me wanting you > Said I was reaching for the moon > But oh you came through > Now they ll have to change their tune > They all said we never could be happy > They laughed at us and how > But ho ho ho > Who s got the last laugh now And now a second verse paying tribute to other creators and their accomplishments > They all laughed at Rockefeller Center https en wikipedia org wiki Rockefeller Center > Now they re fighting to get in > They all laughed at Whitney > And his cotton gin > They all laughed at Fulton and his steamboat > Hershey and his chocolate bar > Ford and his Lizzie > Kept the laughers busy > That s how people are Note that the Ford Model T https en wikipedia org wiki Ford Model T was often referred to as the Tin Lizzie And now the second chorus with slightly different lyrics again returning the subject to romance > They laughed at me wanting you > Said it would be Hello goodbye > But oh you came through > Now they re eating humble pie > They all said we d never get together > Darling let s take a bow > For ho ho ho > Who s got the last laugh > Hee hee hee > Let s at the past laugh > Ha ha ha > Who s got the last laugh now The song ends on a fun and slightly silly note with repeated variations on ways to express laughter using the American English vocabulary Sinatra does a Har har har on the last of these One can look at this song from a variety of vantage points It can appear somewhat dated today with references to Columbus and Whitney s cotton gin But it s also an illuminating sort of time machine that lets us see America through the eyes of Ira Gershwin as it appeared to him in 1937 a history lesson if you will Gershwin lets us feel the optimism and enthusiasm of that time between the two World Wars towards the end of the Jazz Age with prohibition a mistake that could now be comfortably viewed through the rear view mirror ideally with a cocktail in hand The song can also be appreciated simply based on its lyrical and musical inventiveness For example the lines They told Marconi Wireless was a phony is a tight couplet that never gets old at least to my ears Most meaningfully though this song can be viewed as a paean to the possibilities of human development to our capacity for invention and to our continuing ability to surprise one other with the apparently unlimited opportunities for human life on this planet not least of which is our opportunity for romantic entanglement Arguably one could read Steven Johnson s book Wonderland How Play Made the Modern World or extract much the same message from this playful little song But consider again the third line from the end > Let s at the past laugh Notice the tricky inversion of verb and object This line usually gets buried a bit in all of the last laugh celebrating at the end of the song Louis Armstrong even stumbles over the line in his recording with Ella seemingly unable to figure out what it is he s supposed to be singing But what Gershwin is clearly saying is let s have a laugh at the past at all the things we so recently deemed to be impossible at all the people who thought the world would never change Ira Gershwin was born Israel Gershovitz in 1896 the oldest child of two Russian Jews who had emigrated to Manhattan only five years earlier He dropped out of college and worked as a cashier in his father s Turkish baths It was not until the age of 25 that he began a professional songwriting career And he was eventually recognized as one of the most successful songwriters artistically and commercially in American history So if we don t think he s writing about the human capacity for development then we should perhaps consider the song a little more deeply Just because he s having fun doesn t mean he s not serious"

everlasting but which are changing all the time back home to the escapes of Time and Memory John Hiatt seemed to have had much the same sentiments in mind when he penned his song Train to Birmingham Several others have recorded this composition but Hiatt s own version seems to me to be the definitive rendition As the eighth track from the album Dirty Jeans and Mudslide Hymns https amzn to 3wRne18 starts up note how the rhythm of the drums gives you a seat on the train before Hiatt even opens his mouth > I ve been riding on this train > Drinking whiskey for the pain > Just another good ol boy going home See how Hiatt puts us at ease with the first three lines giving us the impression that there s little interesting and nothing novel going on here just another good ol boy going home > And every town I see > Seems to take a part of me > That s the price that you pay when you roam These next three lines are a bit more revealing though and a bit more insightful acknowledging the trade off Hiatt has made by choosing to stray far from his origins allowing the original integrity of his identity to be diluted by his travels > And I lie when I have to > And I cry when I can > But I die a little slower > On the train to Birmingham The chorus emphasizes the compromises and concessions Hiatt has made lying when necessary not always even having time to acknowledge his losses knowing the final destination he is bound for yet still taking what solace he can from riding a train that s headed for his home > I got holes in both my shoes > And a guitar full of blues > And a one way ticket for a remedy > It s the same ol lonesome song > I ve been singing all night long > Hey porter are we out of Tennessee This next verse works in a couple of different ways At first it just sounds like a description of the singer s personal set of woes but with a deeper listen we can recognize that Hiatt is using a series of stock images to carefully position himself in the center of a long American tradition of folk country and blues artists In a way he seems to be saying that the particular origins and traditions of the singers don t matter a great deal because they re all singing the same old lonesome song The final tip off signaling his intentions comes with the last line making reference to the classic Johnny Cash song titled Hey Porter https www johnnycash com track hey porter In addition his reversal of Cash s original question anticipating his departure from Tennessee rather than his arrival to it may be making an oblique comment on a desire to escape the modern commercial lure of Nashville country music Note also that these lines like the opening three also serve to lull the listener into a state of lowered expectations letting us think for the moment that there s nothing going on here we haven t heard a hundred times before But after another repetition of the chorus Hiatt hits us with something original and unexpected delivered in a confessional tone > Well every year I ride this train > To Alabama in the rain > When I get that lonesome feelin in my bones So now for the first time we learn that Hiatt is not just singing about one train ride perhaps motivated by some recent turn of his fortunes but about a recurring trip driven by some deeper unease And then finally we get the profound and surprising conclusion to the song > I never get to Birmingham > Aw but gettin there s not the plan > No I just like the feel of going home And so now Hiatt finally acknowledges that neither this train nor any other vehicle can ever return him to his home what s more he acknowledges that he s known this truth for some time before he ever boarded the train So why is he riding it once again And this is where Hiatt demonstrates the power of song most clearly We are all thinking beings But we are also feeling beings So while we can understand intellectually that we can never go home again as novelist Thomas Wolfe makes clear This knowledge does nothing to reduce the strength of our longing So sometimes no matter how much we know there s no way to resolve this tension And so even after demonstrating the depth of his self knowledge Hiatt brings us full circle back to where we started suggesting that we re still left singing those same old lonesome songs riding those same old trains seeking solace where we can Americana https en wikipedia org wiki Americana music has become a recognized musical term in the past few decades but it s often hard to know exactly how it should be defined I suggest that this song by Hiatt not only exemplifies the term but actually helps us to define it This is music that self consciously draws from folk blues and country roots using small groups of musicians playing acoustic and electrified instruments as well as drums This is music that honors the talent and individuality of particular songwriters singers and musicians At the same time it is music that recognizes and expresses some or all of these common and so far timeless aspects of the American experience + a connection to the land without having ownership of it + a rootedness in one s particular geographic origins + a feeling of belonging to a particular community + but also a desire to travel and explore the vast American landscape to break free and make fresh connections to test one s limits + a choice to speak for a particular community even while the singer chooses to separate themselves from that community through their choice of vocation + a desire to experience the benefits of travel and progress + even while understanding that the tide of American history on which they ride is simultaneously changing their original home to something they might no longer even recognize as such were they to try to return I ll end this tribute and appreciation with a personal confession I was recently listening to a shuffle of my music collection when this little number came along one of Hiatt s to which I had not previously paid much attention frankly and the music lyrics instruments and vocals so resonated with and amplified my own personal feelings at the time that it reduced me to sudden tears So naturally I had to go back and give it a bit more of my attention And discovered a thing of profound beauty that I had not previously recognized as such May I always have such days PS Thanks to reader David P for pointing out that this song was written by Hiatt years before he recorded it as evidenced by a 1992 recording by Kevin Welch as well as Hiatt s own testament in this American Songwriter interview https americansongwriter com john hiatt stating that s the oldest song on the record I wrote it when I was about 19 Hiatt was born in 1952 so that would make the original date of composition sometime in 71 I ve adjusted the date of the song accordingly even though Hiatt himself did not release his own recording until 2011 HB"

the trip was through Although it is a little hard to discern at this point due to the approximate rhymes the six line verses have the unusual rhyming pattern of aaabbb The long lines and the approximate rhymes add to the conversational effect while the repetition of the rhyming seems to emphasize the monotony described by the lyrics Now Seger delivers the first chorus > Here I am > On the road again > There I am > Up on the stage > Here I go > Playing star again > There I go > Turn the page Note the now different but still unusual rhyming pattern abacdbdc The odd numbered lines ending in am am go and go rhyme closely with their immediately preceding or following lines But the even numbered lines ending with again stage again and page take longer for the repeating pattern to occur The overall effect especially with the short line length is of repeating patterns within patterns The final rhyme completes the larger pattern so that both the rhyme and the words provide a complementary sense of ending one unit in a larger work Turn the page The stronger beat on the chorus strengthens the sense of repetition This is a good time to point out the unusual perspectives Seger employs During the verse he refers to himself in the second person You just wish the trip was through In the chorus he speaks of himself in the first person Here I am Even in the verse though there are the alternating perspectives implied by here vs there The overall impression is of Seger the observer standing apart from Seger the performer commenting on his actions but separate from them watching himself going through the motions Seger continues the subdued conversational tone on the second verse although with other instruments quietly making their appearances Seger s electric piano emphasizes the dreamlike feeling of distance with its inherently unnatural sound > Well you walk into a restaurant strung out from the road > And you feel the eyes upon you as you re shaking off the cold > You pretend it doesn t bother you but you just want to explode > Most times you can t hear em talk other times you can > All the same old clich eacute s Is that a woman or a man > And you always seem outnumbered you don t dare make a stand Although still conveying the sense of constraints fencing him in Seger s vocals give some sense of the underlying feelings not fully expressed Notice how on the word cold and the phrase other times you can he manages to break free from the melody slightly as if trying to shake off some heavy burden in addition to the cold Let s take a look at the dramatic structure of the song The first verse provided one self contained scene of the singer traveling from one town to the next Now the second verse conveys another perfect little scene in a scant six lines of a stop in a restaurant The language is used with poetic precision You understand that the protagonist has long hair without the singer ever having to refer to it directly The tension and dramatic conflict of the situation are clearly felt Now Seger delivers the third and final verse > Out there in the spotlight you re a million miles away > Every ounce of energy you try to give away > As the sweat pours out your body like the music that you play > Later in the evening as you lie awake in bed > With the echoes from the amplifiers ringing in your head > You smoke the day s last cigarette remembering what she said The first line of this final verse again conveys the sense of separation between observer and actor by referring to the singer as out there and a million miles away The next two lines add to this effect conveying little of the feelings that the singer must certainly feel while performing but instead limiting the viewpoint to external physical observations the sweat pours out your body like the music that you play Here the sax figure that began the song now reappears As a dramatic mechanism it signals another shift in scene this time the first within a verse It also gives us a sense of having come full circle and completed another cycle another performance delivered Its smoky iridescence also perhaps symbolizes the reference to the music that you play The final three lines paint the closing scene of the day The instrumentation fades leaving Seger naked his vocals unadorned The words show the singer alone with nothing but a cigarette the memory of another girl and the ringing in his head of the performance just delivered Another chorus follows sang as the preceding ones were quietly with understatement But then another chorus comes and Seger s vocals begin to break free a bit finally showing some of the emotion lurking beneath the surface of this actor playing the part of a rock star Brilliantly Seger skips the last line of the verse which so strongly provides a sense of closure instead repeating the preceding line There I go The effect is to leave the listener in suspense waiting for some sense of finality The song then closes with the third appearance of the haunting sax figure which provides the missing feeling of completion I love this recording for a number of reasons 1 Its remarkable honesty You can t listen to this song without feeling like you know Bob Seger and what it was like for him in the early years 2 The beautiful dramatic nature of the song Words vocals and instruments all work together perfectly to give the listener the feeling that he is observing a day in the life of the singer 3 The careful restraint of the performance No screaming guitar solos no overwrought emotions no boozy vocals this track is everything that rock should be and nothing of what rock became known for The original studio version of this song is not available on CD appearing as it did on one of Seger s early albums The available version recorded live is the one I ve analyzed here While I m usually not a big fan of live recordings this one works for two reasons first the performance is as perfectly controlled and delivered as any studio track honed as it was by hundreds of performances on the road second because the song is about performing live the occasional noises from the audience almost sound as if they were contrived added as backdrop to the words There is also the relationship of the performance that was recorded to the subject matter of the song Seger notes in the liner notes to his Greatest Hits collection that the track was recorded in Detroit s Cobo Hall the first time that Seger and his band had headlined in an auditorium of that size So this particular performance turned another page of sorts in Seger s career marking the end of the period that is the subject of the song and the start of his prominence as a national figure Originally published at ReasonToRock com

> > God save the Village Green Note that the song exhibits many of the same virtues that it extols being itself small carefully crafted and unassuming There are a number of elements of this song that I find remarkable Its emphasis on social unity created through the repetition of the phrases We are and God save the as well as by the understated smoothly harmonizing vocals from the band members Its emphasis on critical elements of social progress preserving the old ways while still protecting the new ways Its emphasis on humanizing our society both by respect for the inexplicable quirks of popular culture as well as buildings designed for humans rather than large institutions Its emphasis on common action created through the various different types of organizations cited and even drawing the listener in through the concluding question What more can we do Thematically the song can easily be thought of as George Santayana san set to music Here are some similar thoughts from his 1906 work The Life of Reason Reason in Common Sense reason > Progress far from consisting in change depends on retentiveness When change is absolute there remains no being to improve and no direction is set for possible improvement and when experience is not retained infancy is perpetual Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it The song seems even more relevant today than when it was first released for several reasons 1 As growing environmental issues have us all watching the Tragedy of the commons totc playing out on a global scale we can see The Kinks concern for saving the village green in a new light 2 As we see England America and other countries facing increasing polarization dividing their urban and rural populations we can appreciate the value of Davies respect for traditional village life 3 As we observe the terrible toll on our society taken by tech companies whose motto is Move fast and break things we can gain new respect for the singers avowed mission of Preserving the old ways from being abused and Protecting the new ways for me and for you Ray Davies and The Kinks certainly recorded a number of great songs but this one I think really stands alone for me It s hard to think of a comparable song from any artist that so calls upon us as listeners to knit together the splintered pieces of our society into a coherent whole that works for all of us

low > And I do believe it s time > To get back to Miss Fanny > You know she s the only one > Who sent me here with her > Regards for everyone > > Repeat Chorus One of the remarkable things about this song is that even though there is nothing about it that obviously brands it as country music or as gospel or as religious music it still manages to summon up ghosts of The Carter Family carter and that rich vein of traditional American music that sings of sacrifice suffering family and redemption There is to start with the opening verse that talks about pulling into Nazareth and being unable to find a place to sleep with its obvious similarity to the story of the birth of Christ We get extra meaning from this verse when we learn that Robbie Robertson was also thinking of Nazareth Pennsylvania as the home of Martin Guitar martin a natural destination for a very different sort of pilgrimage for a guitar player born and raised in Canada And then there are also references to the Devil to Luke to Moses and to the Judgment Day all contributing to the overall sense that our singer is working his way through a very Christian landscape And when he talks about catching a cannonball to take him down the line we understand that he is talking about a train something like the Wabash Cannonball wabash as described in an American folk song first published in 1882 Structurally the song is just about perfect in its simplicity The first verse tells us of the singer s arrival in town the fifth verse tells us of his departure and the three verses in between recount his various encounters while visiting Just reading over the lyrics one is tempted to view the song in a comic vein as one colorful character after another denies the singer s varied requests while at the same time thrusting some new unwanted companion into his arms until the singer finally decides to return home revealing that his only reason for visiting town in the first place was to convey Miss Fanny s regards for everyone From this perspective it seems to fall neatly into an American style of storytelling probably best evoked through a comparison to Mark Twain you can almost picture this as one of Huck Finn s stops on his travels down the Mississippi But in listening to the original performance by The Band https geo music apple com us album the weight remastered 1440814725 i=1440815149 itsct=music box link itscg=30200 at=1l3vwJP ls=1 app=music produced by John Simon the music lends the song a whole different sense of gravitas Vocals bass drums guitar and piano all convey an earnest depth of feeling that belie any sort of tongue in cheek that might have been present in the unadorned lyrics And while composer Robertson may have been able to maintain a sort of ironic distance from his subject matter lead vocalist and drummer Levon Helm the sole American member of The Band hailing from Arkansas delivers these lines as if he had been living them his entire life And what does this music tell us The verses are delivered with a sort of plodding bottom heavy weary cadence signaling a sort of inevitability to the outcome even before the lyrics provide the details of each encounter But then there s the magnificent chorus The piano lifts us up then other voices join in to sing Take a load off Fanny take a load for free Take a load off Fanny Then the instruments pause dramatically as one two and then three voices come together a cappella singing and and and and then gradually converging to sing you put the load right on me The backing instruments then gradually descend with a delicate inchoate vocal in the background the drums kick in and we re into the next verse So what are we to make of all this thematically What do we come away with At this point it s helpful to refer to the photo titled Next of Kin that graced the back of the Music from Big Pink album cover and is shown above It was taken by Elliott Landy landy at the Danko chicken farm in Simcoe Ontario and features the members of The Band alongside many of their family members including children and grandparents If this photo had appeared on an album cover for The Mothers of Invention or some other rock groups of the sixties it would have been with a sense of irony But none of that is present here This was The Band saying this is who we are this is what we re made of this is the stock we come from this is the legacy we carry with us And it s also helpful at this point to realize that having reviewed all of the song s lyrics the title of this song simple as it is appears nowhere in those vocals So what is this Weight Well now let s treat ourselves to the video recorded to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the song video the aforementioned Song Around the World rendition And as I watch and listen to this diverse set of singers and players from all over the planet including composer Robbie Robertson and former Beatle Ringo Starr come together to perform this moving piece I can t help but feel that they are singing about our human family our next of kin bound to us by common genetics but also by a common reverence for the heritage that has been passed to us along with the responsibility to in turn pass it on to others to pass on this simple message that despite all appearances despite the daily insults and rejections we are all part of something larger sharing a common human culture one that stretches back into the past and on into the future and across the globe spanning languages and national boundaries And so this I think is why we finally raise our voices not in sorrow but in a sort of high lonesome joy accepting this weight of responsibility with all the grace that we can muster knowing that when someone we love and respect asks us to pass their kindest regards on to others we really have no choice but to do so no matter how we may be received And so just as our singer accepts the burden of carrying Miss Fanny s message even after coming to understand its full weight these players and singers from around the world seem to have in turn accepted the responsibility to carry on this message from The Band fifty years on knowing that the song is still as meaningful and true and necessary as when it first graced the airwaves back in 1968 And so finally this tremendous song joins the great tapestry one more thread to be passed down one more timeless piece of art fleshing out this idea of what it means to be human to be a member of the human family to be connected to one another by bonds both joyous and grievous May we all know such kith

        content: "I ve been thinking a lot lately about this song by Robert Earl Keen https www robertearlkeen com first recorded by Joe Ely http www ely com for his Love and Danger album released in 1992 It is be advised a difficult song in that the narrator talks about shooting and killing people and tries to justify his actions So before I start sharing my thoughts perhaps it is best to issue a clarification that no one here is advocating for any kind of gun violence Heck I don t even own a gun But it is a great song I consider both Joe Ely s version and the later recording by the songwriter himself to be excellent renditions so feel free to listen to either or both And now let s dive into the words > I crossed the desert in a dining car > In the spring of ninety one > I met some people drinking at the bar > They were laughing having fun > I told em that I hadn t heard the joke > That was so hilarious > They said that I was just a dumb cowpoke > I didn t want to make a fuss > > So I shot em down > One by one > I left them along the rails > I only use my gun > Whenever kindness fails First of all let me note that dining cars https en wikipedia org wiki Dining car were a normal part of long distance trains by the mid 1880 s so for all we know at this point Keene s narrator could be talking about an event in 1891 or 1991 So if we like we can certainly think about the events of the song as being comfortably distant in terms of our American history as we often do when watching a Western film So now let s consider the scene that plays out Our narrator tries to join the group at the bar and instead of meeting with friendly acceptance is laughed at and called unflattering names Let s see can we find any parallels in our modern society Anything like this happening in schools across our country Might the folks at the bar be considered elites in some sense Does anything like this ever play out on social media Does it remind anyone of a certain presidential candidate referring to a considerable group of her fellow Americans as a basket of deplorables https en wikipedia org wiki Basket of deplorables I think Keane might be onto something here in terms of capturing a certain zeitgeist of our modern times don t you And then the final few lines unfold in vivid dramatic fashion > I didn t want to make a fuss This line suggests that despite the insults the narrator doesn t want to argue the point perhaps suggesting that he might simply walk away > So I shot em down This next line hits us like a gut punch as we understand that for this narrator making a fuss would mean engaging in shouting or verbal recriminations But shooting them in our narrator s world is a simple direct tidy solution to the problem > One by one This line suggests that he killed the group not in some mad frenzy but carefully and deliberately > I left them along the rails This line suggests a couple of things first the idea of moving on from people and events with the speed and intractable power of a locomotive and then the picture of bodies lying in the desert sun next to the railroad tracks in the middle of a desert again bringing up images from a real or imagined American past something we might visualize again as a scene from a film perhaps a John Ford Western > I only use my gun This penultimate line of the chorus suggests that the narrator is a man of restraint with a strict code governing his behavior > Whenever kindness fails And then this final line coming after everything else hits us as another surprise suggesting that this killer s preferred mode of interaction is kindness and that the story we have just heard is really all about a failure to exercise this valuable human trait So now let s move on to the second verse > The moon was in the sign of Scorpio > The sun was at my back > I didn t know how far the train would go > Until the law would find my track > I saw the brakeman and the engineer > Drinking wine and eating brie > I asked them who would brake and who would steer > They started pointing back at me > > So I shot em down > One by one > I left em long the rails > I only use my gun > Whenever kindness fails So the first four lines of the second verse paint another vivid picture and again one that could have come from an old Western film But then we come up against the brakeman and the engineer drinking wine and eating brie Hold on a minute If it weren t clear before that Keen is talking about something happening today in modern times it certainly is now no wine and brie ever appeared in a Western film And then these two railroad workers go on to further abdicate their responsibilities not only hedonistically indulging in their upscale and very cosmopolitan treats but suggesting that the narrator is now on his own to control the speed of the train Well by now we know how this encounter is likely to end don t we But what an image In a song written just before the start of the Bill Clinton presidency Keen presents perhaps a defining symbol of the neoliberal era https prospect org economy neoliberalism political success economic failure with global elites kicking back and enjoying themselves saying it s not their job to steer things because we ll all be better off if they just leave things up to the invisible hand https en wikipedia org wiki Invisible hand of a global free market And as in the song we can by now see how well this plan works out So now let s turn to the final verse > I only have a moment to explain > Just a chance to let you know > When it s time for you to board the train > There are two ways you can go > You can ride the wheels into the sun > Feel the cool wind on your face > Or you can laugh into a loaded gun > and you ll likely lose your place > > Yeah I shot em down > One by one > Then I left em long the rails > I only use my gun > Whenever kindness fails This final verse is all about the significance and importance and urgency of making the right decision The narrator only has a moment to explain The decision point is approaching and can t be avoided when it s time for you to board the train And then the stark difference between the two possible outcomes the cool wind on your face vs losing your place by way of a loaded gun and ending up left along the rails What is the message here in this last verse Actions matter They have consequences that can t be undone Decision points come quickly Be prepared And then we end things with a final repetition of the chorus this time with the last two lines slightly altered emphasizing the sad finality of the consequences of a poor decision while again making use of a common association with a train > Yeah I shot em down > One by one > I left them along the rails > When I use my gun > That lonesome whistle wails What is this song about This is not a song about killing It is a song about the importance of showing care to others through our words and our deeds And about the implacable consequences of failures to do so Why do I still appreciate this song after thirty years and so many repeated listenings Well if I do a Google search for sayings about kindness I get a lot of nice treacly well intentioned words that don t have much of an impact on me Of course I could remind myself of the importance of kindness by rereading the recent book by Michael E McCullough titled The Kindness of Strangers How a Selfish Ape Invented a New Moral Code https bookshop org p books the kindness of strangers how a selfish ape invented a new moral code michael e mccullough 13014489 Or I could listen once again to this four minute gem from Robert Earl Keen which reminds me in no uncertain terms that kindness is a necessary part of the social glue that binds us all together and that humiliation and contempt and disdain have no place in human relationships at any scale It s a reminder we can t hear too often"

multiple occasions but the first released recording was by The Band https www reasontorock com artists band html and their original studio recording https music apple com us album when i paint my masterpiece remastered 1440841468 i=1440841881 is still the version I m partial to Let s just review the lyrics shall we Ideally of course along with the music > Oh the streets of Rome are filled with rubble > Ancient footprints are everywhere > You can almost think that you re seein double > On a cold dark night on the Spanish Stairs https en wikipedia org wiki Spanish Steps > Got to hurry on back to my hotel room > Where I ve got me a date with Botticelli https en wikipedia org wiki Sandro Botticelli s niece > She promised that she d be right there with me > When I paint my masterpiece > > Oh the hours I ve spent inside the Coliseum https en wikipedia org wiki Colosseum > Dodging lions and wastin time > Oh those mighty kings of the jungle I could hardly stand to see em https en wikipedia org wiki Inaugural games of the Flavian Amphitheatre > Yes it sure has been a long hard climb > Train wheels runnin through the back of my memory > When I ran on the hilltop following a pack of wild geese > Someday everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody > When I paint my masterpiece > > Sailin round the world in a dirty gondola > Oh to be back in the land of Coca Cola > > I left Rome and landed in Brussels > On a plane ride so bumpy that I almost cried > Clergymen in uniform and young girls pullin muscles > Everyone was there to greet me when I stepped inside > Newspapermen eating candy > Had to be held down by big police > Someday everything is gonna be diff rent > When I paint that masterpiece So what is going on here As is usual for Dylan one can find many levels of meaning many wheels turning beneath the surface First let me point out that as with another Dylan song I ve written about All Along The Watchtower https lexiconofsong org all along the watchtower html it s a deceptively simple and seemingly straightforward song only three verses plus a silly little bridge that is often omitted no big words or nightmarish images as is the case with many of his other works In one sense it s just a little travelogue apparently descended from that familiar literary form practiced by every school child when they are asked by their teacher to write down how they spent their summer vacations And so there is nothing here that calls attention to itself nothing here that screams to the listener look I m being artistic But this of course is part of Dylan s artistry if one is going to write a story about an artist wishing to create their masterpiece at some future time one can t make the story itself an obvious masterpiece And so there is a sort of Aw shucks quality to Dylan s words here a contrived modesty that draws the listener s attention away from the current work in order to have them instead turn their focus along with the singer towards some ideal future work So what else is going on here In some ways this feels like Dylan doing his Henry James https en wikipedia org wiki Henry James bit contrasting American and European sensibilities This contrast is implicit in the tone of his observations which sound in many ways like those of a typical American tourist visiting the Continent for the first time And then of course there is the more explicit bridge in which he wishes to escape a dirty gondola and return to the land of Coca Cola And while a more diverse and sophisticated modern audience might not think of this famous soft drink in the same way it s good to remember Andy Warhol s comments https practopian org authors andy warhol html about the product offered during roughly this same time period > What s great about this country is that America started the tradition where the richest consumers buy essentially the same things as the poorest You can be watching TV and see Coca Cola and you know that the President drinks Coke Liz Taylor drinks Coke and just think you can drink Coke too A Coke is a Coke and no amount of money can get you a better Coke than the one the bum on the corner is drinking All the Cokes are the same and all the Cokes are good Liz Taylor knows it the President knows it the bum knows it and you know it And then if we put this together with Dylan s comment that it sure has been a long hard climb we can get some sense of his appreciation for his homeland Dylan is better known for his critiques of American society but here perhaps we catch him feeling a bit homesick for the country that produced Woody Guthrie the artist who penned This Land Is Your Land and a society that at least expressed and aspired to egalitarian ideals no matter how imperfectly realized And then there is also a strong Jamesian sense of the almost crushing burden of human history experienced so directly in Europe Lines like ancient footprints are everywhere you can almost think that you re seeing double and dodging lions all give you the sense that the singer finds it hard at times to separate current experience from the historical realities that are so vividly depicted all around him And then this is contrasted with the simpler personal American memories of the sounds of train wheels and running on a hilltop following a pack of wild geese an unaffected sense of oneness with nature as opposed to being continually surrounded by storied human artifacts and a sense of active movement as opposed to passive observation and remembrance Some of the lyrics to the song are varied between renditions Dylan s own deliveries talk of a date with Botticelli s niece This must have been a bit of a reach for Levon Helm in The Band s version though so he translates this into a more homespun reference to a pretty little girl from Greece But Dylan s wording is notable because it is the only reference in the song to any of the European old masters whose works Dylan must surely have seen while in Europe and whose art must surely have inspired this song to start with There is a certain irony here because the term masterpiece is almost always and certainly in terms of European art typically enjoyed by tourists applied in hindsight and often posthumously And so for an artist as prolific as Dylan there is a definite comic aspect to the idea of him looking forward to a specific time and place on which he will create his masterpiece This feels like the protagonist again taking on the appearance of an American bumpkin simplistically thinking that he might not only one day paint his masterpiece but also know with absolute certainty that the work just completed was indeed his masterwork For the truth is that it is none of the artist s business to make such a claim or even to use such a term the artist s only business is to make more art And Dylan knows this and I think has always known this better than any of us But there s still more here Consider these words from Dylan https www bobdylan com books chronicles volume one > Creativity has much to do with experience observation and imagination and if any one of those key elements is missing it doesn t work So in this compact little song Dylan is giving us a lesson in creativity Like many songwriters who went on to become famous the powers of anonymous observation that he could draw upon to fashion his earlier works were lost to him once he himself was the one being continuously observed by everyone around him No matter Dylan seems to be saying here He is still observing still experiencing still using his imagination to whip these scraps into art even if he is only observing the same things other toursts have seen experiencing the mundane details of a bumpy plane ride and reporting what he sees as the object of everyone else s attention And so he takes all these little observations and experiences these bits that started out just appearing to be a sort of simple travelogue and transforms them into a seamless flow of words and notes that manage to be an expression unique to a particular artist and yet conveying ideas and emotions that are close to universal And he does this as a sort of magician performing the trick as we are watching with us left wondering how he pulls it off And yet there s still more waiting for us here in this little song Let me share a quote from Rubin s book > By conventional definition the purpose of art is to create physical and digital artifacts To fill shelves with pottery books and records > > But that end work is a by product of a greater desire We aren t creating to produce or sell material products The act of creation is an attempt to enter a mysterious realm A longing to transcend What we create allows us to share glimpses of an inner landscape one that is beyond our understanding Art is our portal to the unseen world And so finally behind all of these other layers Dylan s song also manages to sincerely convey a longing for some sort of transcendence some holy state in which all of the dirty details of real life fall away some hallowed place in which everything is as smooth as a rhapsody where his true love will always be by his side and where his work will achieve mastery He knows and we know that no such state can ever be achieved But such knowledge in no way diminishes our shared longing nor our striving to grow ever closer to such a perfected state But let s take the notions of mystical transcendence down a notch for one of the joys of this song is that there is something here for all of us Dylan may now be the winner of a Nobel prize but he s not really trying here to present himself as some exalted artist If you look at the last couple of lines of each verse he s not talking about perfecting his art but just having a few little things go right for a little while without any flies in the ointment And this is one reason why I prefer Levon Helm s rendition including his date with a pretty little girl from Greece rather than Botticelli s niece and also why I like including the reference to Coca Cola because these are references that bring the narrative down to a sort of everyman level And so if I m spending a few hours working on my little Mac app Notenik trying to make some new feature work right and instead having it go wrong in more ways than I thought possible I can easily hum this little song to myself while imagining how good I ll feel when it s all working perfectly So I suspect as perhaps Dylan knew that we all have our little masterpieces we re working on reflecting our varied interests and aspirations and that we re all looking forward to having a few things go right for us even if only for a little while"

        content: "This song was a huge hit single for Cream off their Wheels of Fire album Lyricist Pete Brown says of the track It was a miracle it worked considering it was me writing a monologue about a new flat Sandford 1999 Let s take a look at the words Brown wrote about his new accommodations > In the white room with black curtains near the station > Black roof country no gold pavements tired starlings > Silver horses ran down moonbeams in your dark eyes > Dawn light smiles on you leaving my contentment > > I ll wait in this place where the sun never shines > Wait in this place where the shadows run from themselves > > You said no strings could secure you at the station > Platform ticket restless diesels goodbye windows > I walked into such a sad time at the station > As I walked out felt my own need just beginning > > I ll wait in the queue when the trains come back > Lie with you where the shadows run from themselves > > At the party she was kindness in the hard crowd > Consolation for the old wound now forgotten > Yellow tigers crouched in jungles in her dark eyes > She s just dressing goodbye windows tired starlings > > I ll sleep in this place with the lonely crowd > Lie in the dark where the shadows run from themselves Probably the first observation worth making is that this is a fairly serious bit of modern poetry to be used as a lyric for a rock song Considering its singularly uncatchy title its lack of rhyme or alliteration and the absence of any easily discernible or involving subject matter one might even agree with its author that it is a miracle that it worked at all The next thing one notices perhaps is that despite the absence of other traditional poetic trappings the lyrics have a very structured and highly unusual meter The verses have twelve syllables per line and these tend primarily to fall into three feet https www poetryfoundation org learn glossary terms foot per line four syllables per foot with the accent on the third syllable of each foot The conformity to this meter is not perfect and the first two syllables of each four syllable foot tend in particular to vary from this pattern But the effect is still striking and the attempt to stick to this pattern is one explanation for the frequent variation from regular grammatical structures since it would be hard to accommodate both Given all this other variation from normal pop standards it is positively reassuring to see that the words fall into a straightforward verse and chorus structure Although each chorus is worded differently the repetition of the phrase where the shadows run from themselves to conclude each chorus provides some familiar grounding The choruses also provide some relief from the rather demanding meter in the verses offering a more familiar beat to the listener s ears The future tense used consistently in the choruses also offers some contrast to the present and past tenses used in the verses We also find some reassurance when we turn our attention to the meaning of the poem seeing that there is a familiar boy meets girl boy loses girl theme However the absence of a smooth narrative flow is somewhat disconcerting The poem is written in the first person and what we hear are a series of somewhat disjointed observations made by the poet What makes the poem interesting in part is that the nature of the observations shift dramatically and frequently If we take the first verse for example we find that the first two lines offer literal descriptions of almost random elements of external physical reality In the white room with black curtains near the station Black roof country no gold pavements tired starlings The third line however shifts to a fantastic metaphor Silver horses ran down moonbeams in your dark eyes The fourth line shifts again mixing the first two modes somewhat and adding an internal observation on the poet s feelings Dawn light smiles on you leaving my contentment Beneath the somewhat jumbled narrative of the boy girl story line however lies another conflict and one that is really at the center of the poem What is most striking about the words are the utter lack of meaning or feeling in the poet outside of his contact with the girl in the story If we take the poet s observations as reflections of his inner state what we find initially is a flat existence Let s look again at the first two lines In the white room with black curtains near the station Black roof country no gold pavements tired starlings Note the monochromatic nature of the poet s world the room is white the curtains and rooftops are black the pavements are not gold Even the birds are tired Now contrast this flat colorless language with that of the next line Silver horses ran down moonbeams in your dark eyes Now we have excitement motion color beauty energy This same sort of contrast is continued in the remaining verses Beginning the third verse for example we find that even at a party the crowd is hard with the woman offering the only kindness And again we have color and life associated with the woman and the woman only Yellow tigers crouched in jungles in her dark eyes The choruses make the poet s situation more poignant referring to his room as a place where the sun never shines and where the shadows run from themselves At this point it is hard not to identify the poet s room with his own internal consciousness Certainly it is hard to picture an objective physical meaning to the image of shadows running from themselves But if we take this as an internal symbol then this makes perfect sense given what we have learned in the verses it is easy to see the poet himself as one of the shadows running from himself in order to escape his colorless view of the world and his own isolation I have spent a lot of time focusing exclusively on the words but as we turn to the recording produced by Felix Pappalardi we will find that the music beautifully amplifies and extends these devices we have discovered in the lyrics To begin with the track opens with a brilliantly ominous sound composed partly from the unlikely rock instruments of viola and tympani Ginger Baker provides the transition to the first verse by striking his snare and then we are off The melody and chords provided by Jack Bruce perfectly complement the lyrics provided by Pete Brown with the pacing of the melody for the verse emphasizing the unusual meter with a pause after each four syllables neatly breaking each line up into three feet The descending melodic line is suggestive of the mood and seriousness of the piece Bruce s reading of the lyrics is relatively flat and unemotional again reinforcing the lyric intent Bruce s bass and Baker s drums are propulsive but slow and regimented again suggesting the internal state of the singer Clapton s guitar lurks in the background at this point quietly playing the chords going almost unnoticed Bruce sings the chorus in a sweet falsetto emphasizing the poignancy of the lyrics As we end the chorus and start the second verse however a new element is introduced in the form of Clapton s lead guitar The contrast between Clapton s lines and the rest of the song is extreme The stinging guitar is played with heavy wah wah pedal at a higher pitch than the vocal and other instruments and with melodic lines that seem to fight against the slowly descending lines of the rest of the track After the second verse and chorus the ominous sound of the opening is repeated taking the place of a bridge or solo either of which would be a distraction Clapton s guitar returns with a vengeance in the third verse now openly playing on top of the singer and other musicians Clapton is simply brilliant here He improvises ruthlessly on guitar opposing the melodies and rhythms of the rest of the performers His playing is uncontained seemingly uncontainable as it claws and kicks against the impending doom of the rest of the song In the context of the words and music Clapton s guitar seems to represent some anarchic seminal life force fighting against the colorless regimented neatly contained emotional life of the singer Following the third and final verse and chorus the ominous sound is repeated then extended slightly as if the song were ending But then the music starts up again with a crash from Baker s drums and Clapton s guitar returns to its heroic struggle against the forces of darkness and lifelessness The music slowly fades the conflict unresolved the tension still continuing This recording is simply a brilliant example of the best that rock https www reasontorock com elements overview html has to offer Lyrics vocals music and instrumental parts all work together to produce a complex unified unique effect

        summary: "<p>It&#8217;s certainly fair to categorize this song as a religious one, and more particularly as a Christian song, and yet, even though I consider myself to be a non-believer, my lack of faith doesn&#8217;t diminish my appreciation for this song in the slightest: if anything, I think it increases it.

        content: "I first heard this song as the title track on the monumental 1972 album by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band which they recorded with a number of country music greats who were still alive at the time This song is usually recorded under the title of Will the Circle be Unbroken but it s also known by the name Can the Circle be Unbroken wp The song was the result of a reworking by A P Carter ap of the hymn Will the Circle be Unbroken wp2 The song was first released in 1935 on a single by the Carter Family cf There are a number of wonderful recordings of this song that I can recommend I ll list them in chronological sequence The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band track1 from their 1972 album Will the Circle be Unbroken album1 The Country Gentlemen track2 from their 1988 album Folk Songs and Bluegrass album2 Tim O Brien and Darrell Scott track3 from their 2012 album We re Usually A Lot Better Than This album3 as the second half of a medley starting with When There s No One Around All three albums by the way are worth repeated listening in their entirety It s certainly fair to categorize this song as a religious one and more particularly as a Christian one and yet even though I consider myself to be a non believer my lack of faith doesn t diminish my appreciation for this song in the slightest if anything I think it increases it For unlike many songs that we could put in this category this song does not seek to proselytize or ask us to accept any particular religious teaching Let s see how it does work and consider what it is doing > I was standing by my window > On one cold and cloudy day > When I saw the hearse come rolling > For to carry my mother away Note how this first verse paints a simple but altogether complete dramatic scene for us We can see the singer and the sight that s he is viewing Just four simple lines twenty five of the simplest words in the English language and yet it is hard to hear them without feeling a wave of desolate bereavement I d like to save consideration of the song s chorus until the end so let s proceed straight to the second verse > Well I told that undertaker > Undertaker please drive slow > For this body you are hauling > Lord I hate to see her go Again it is a very simple scene described using common everyday words And so far we have heard no suggestion of religious belief In fact instead of painting a picture of some sort of spiritual afterlife we are being given very graphic physical images of corporeal death Note especially the use of the word hauling in this respect There s no attempt to gussy up what is happening here it is a physical person performing a job driving a vehicle hauling a load and ultimately taking that load under the ground > Oh I followed close behind her > Tried to hold up and be brave > But I could not hide my sorrow > When they laid her in the grave Again the story continues in a very simple linear physical fashion > I went back home my home was lonesome > Missed my mother she was gone > All of my brothers sisters crying > What a home so sad and lone And now in the last verse we have the completion of this little tale And in the spare telling we have more than a suggestion of the sparseness of the lives of these characters There is no mention of flowers no mention of a church no word of a supportive group of family and friends in attendance no meal no food no mention of any speeches eulogizing the lost loved one In short there are none of the usual conventions that we employ to soften the blow of death nothing to gloss over this naked experience of loss that the song has just shared with us Instead we just have these very simple brush strokes Part of the genius of the song is that there are enough details here to place us fully in the story as it unfolds to let us see and feel at one with the singer yet there are no details that limit the universality of the tale In fact I listened to this song on the day that my own mother was buried in a country churchyard a few years ago and there was nothing in that moment to separate the singer s grief from my own So now finally let us consider the chorus of the song > Will the circle be unbroken > by and by Lord by and by > Please tell me there s a better home a waiting > in the sky Lord in the sky At the beginning of the third line I ve inserted words sung by O Brien and Scott in their rendition because those words seem to provide a better fit for these last two lines in the greater context of the song as a whole And so here in this moment of loss the singer asks if what has been broken what has been lost on this day may someday be restored and once again be made whole And who hasn t felt this same longing No matter what your religious orientation no matter what your once or future beliefs who can lose a beloved family member a parent in particular without feeling that something once whole has been broken and without feeling a great yearning to have that family restored and made whole again This is not a song of religious dogma it is a song that speaks to a wellspring of religious feeling to a tragic knowledge of time and what it brings to all of us and yet an inescapable human desire to transcend death in some way to feel a part of something larger that will live on after death This feeling is part of what it means to be human to know that our parents meant so much to us to know how much they passed on to us in terms of their knowledge and beliefs and feelings and love and with that bequest also passed on an obligation for us to keep these gifts alive This is perhaps why the name of this song is so moving as the title for the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band album from 1972 because the recording of that album was itself an attempt to acknowledge the great gifts bequeathed to a younger generation by their elders and to document those gifts in a way that could be in turn passed on to others So while this song comes from a Christian tradition for me it is also a song of humanism because it so vividly describes an important dimension of what being human means for all of us album1 https geo music apple com us album will the circle be unbroken
