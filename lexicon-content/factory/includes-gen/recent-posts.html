<p>This song was released on John Prine&#8217;s first, self-titled, album, when the singer-songwriter was just twenty-five years of age. Prine grew up near Chicago, and studied at that city&#8217;s <a href="https://www.oldtownschool.org">Old Town School of Folk Music</a> (a fine establishment I&#8217;ve visited several times, and one that is still delivering concerts and classes today). </p>

<p>Prine was working as a mailman before turning to music as a full-time career. He remembers delivering newspapers to a Baptist old peoples home where he had to go room-to-room, and there developed something of an affinity for our aging population. </p>

<p>These memories and observations led him to write a song called &#8220;Hello In There&#8221; for that first album. A friend liked that song so much that he suggested Prine write &#8220;another song about old people.&#8221; And that suggestion led Prine to pen &#8220;Angel from Montgomery,&#8221; pulling the song&#8217;s words and images from some deeper reservoir. </p>

<p>My earliest memory of this song is hearing it on the first album by The Band, <em>Music from Big Pink</em>, back in 1968. I understood then that this was the one song on the album that was written neither by members of The Band nor by Bob Dylan, but didn&#8217;t know much else about it at the time. </p>

<p>Then, a few years later, I discovered that it was one of the few songs that my father and I both knew, and could play together on our guitars. Turned out he had probably heard it as recorded by The Country Gentlemen on their 1960 album, <em>Country Songs Old &amp; New</em>, or had simply heard this same group perform the song at one of their many shows at the Crossroads, outside of DC, a venue my dad was known to have frequented. </p>

<p>And then, I found the song included on the Rosanne Cash album <em>The List</em>, the title referring to a list of essential American songs as identified by <em>her</em> father, Johnny Cash. </p>

<p>But then, later, it just started to turn up everywhere. </p>

<p>A couple of things that happened recently got me cogitating on the idea of language as playground. </p>

<p>First, I had a chance to hear <a href="https://acurzan.english.lsa.umich.edu">Anne Curzan</a> speak. Curzan is the talented and engaging dean of the College of Literature, Science and the Arts at the University of Michigan (my alma mater), and is also a linguist who studies the history of the English language. Her bio states that she &#8220;aims to promote a culture based in purpose and contributing to the common good, the power of learning, <em>the value of play</em> [emphasis mine], and the importance of well-being.&#8221; </p>

<p>Well, I&#8217;m here to tell you: any time you stir together the value of play and the study of the English language in the same pitcher, you&#8217;re mixing up a cocktail that I will happily imbibe. </p>

<p>As children, our thoughts about death are stuff of dreams and fairy tales. As adults we learn to suppress these thoughts because we are busy getting on with things. But as teenagers, in this transition between nursery rhymes and real life, we tend to approach this topic with a frankness and curiosity that can be somewhat startling. </p>

<p>Laura Nyro wrote her song &#8220;And When I Die&#8221; at the age of 17, and her refreshing treatment of the subject shows none of the reverence or piety that we learn to adopt as adults. </p>

<p>Let&#8217;s look over her lyrics. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>And when I die and when I&#8217;m dead, dead and gone,   <br />
There&#8217;ll be one child born and a world to carry on, to carry on.  </p>

<p>I&#8217;m not scared of dying and I don&#8217;t really care.   <br />
If it&#8217;s peace you find in dying, well, then let the time be near. </p>

</p>


<p>The history of Leonard Cohen&#8217;s song &#8220;Hallelujah&#8221; is a fascinating one. Cohen&#8217;s songs had never really been embraced by the masses, and his first recording of &#8220;Hallelujah&#8221; in the early eighties was part of an album so lacking in obvious commercial appeal that the president of CBS Records responded to it by saying: &#8220;What is this? This isn&#8217;t pop music. We&#8217;re not releasing it. This is a disaster.&#8221; </p>

<p>That recording was released, however, a little later on a small independent label, but few people took note of the album or of this particular song. Even for Cohen&#8217;s small set of fans, it did not seem like a particularly memorable recording. </p>

<p>But then a funny series of events began to play out over the next couple of decades. John Cale, formerly of the Velvet Underground, and himself not a household name, recorded a version of the song for a Cohen tribute album in 1991. </p>

<p>Let&#8217;s just read the lyrics through first (and listen to the music), and then talk about it. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I pulled into Nazareth,    <br />
Was feeling about half past dead.    <br />
I just need some place     <br />
Where I can lay my head.    <br />
"Hey, mister, can you tell me     <br />
Where a man might find a bed?"    <br />
He just grinned and shook my hand,    <br />
&#8220;No&#8221; was all he said.    </p>

<p>Take a load off Fanny.    <br />
Take a load for free.      <br />
Take a load off Fanny,     <br />
And (and) (and) you put the load right on me.    <br />
(You put the load right on me)    </p>

I went looking for a place to hide.    <br />
When I saw Carmen and the Devil    <br />
Walking side by side. </p>

<p>I&#8217;d been aware of Paul Thorn for some time, but didn&#8217;t really become a fan until I saw him live last summer at The Ark in Ann Arbor. I convinced an old University of Michigan roommate to come with me while I was in town, as an opportunity to catch up, but we were both caught off guard by how much we loved Thorn&#8217;s show. </p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been listening to Thorn&#8217;s recordings regularly since then, and can now bear witness to a great catalog that stands up to deep and repeated listening.  </p>

<p>Musically Thorn reminds me of Delbert McClinton and a few other artists who have somewhat belatedly been collected under the <em>Americana</em> banner. </p>

<p>From the Dictionary app on my iMac: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>fruitcake: 1. A cake containing dried fruit and nuts. 2. (informal) an eccentric or insane person. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;ve always considered &#8220;Fruitcakes&#8221; to be Jimmy Buffet&#8217;s masterwork. The musical backing is infectious, swaying and danceable, and the background vocals add depth. The words are cleverly crafted, and perfectly suited to Buffett&#8217;s conversational, wisecracking delivery. </p>

<p>The song is from 1993, and contains some dated references, but these just add to the fun for me. </p>

<p>The singer starts with a spoken introduction, setting up the verses that will follow. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>You know I was talking to my friend Desdemona the other day. She runs this space station bake shop down near Boomtown. She told me that human beings are flawed individuals, that the cosmic bakers took us out of the oven a little too early, and that&#8217;s the reason we&#8217;re as crazy as we are, and I believe it. </p>

<p>This is a rather amazing song by The Kinks, first released in 1968. </p>

<p>I loved this song from the moment I first heard it, but my appreciation for it has only grown over the years. </p>

<p>Consider: </p>

<ul>
<li>In the same year that John Lennon and Yoko Ono released an album called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unfinished_Music_No._1:_Two_Virgins"><em>Two Virgins</em></a> (certainly using the term to refer to themselves metaphorically, not literally), with an album cover showing the two artists completely naked, Ray Davies wrote a song with the immortal line, &#8220;God save little shops, china cups and virginity&#8221; (and Davies, to be clear,  delivered this line quite seriously and quite literally); </li>

<p>I first heard this song as the title track on the monumental 1972 album by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, which they recorded with a number of country music greats who were still alive at the time. </p>

<p>This song is usually recorded under the title of &#8220;Will the Circle be Unbroken,&#8221; but it&#8217;s also known by the name &#8220;Can the Circle be Unbroken.&#8221; The song was the result of a reworking by A.P. Carter of the hymn &#8220;Will the Circle be Unbroken?.&#8221; The song was first released in 1935, on a single by the Carter Family. </p>

<p>There are a number of wonderful recordings of this song that I can recommend. I&#8217;ll list them in chronological sequence. </p>

<p>The music for this song was composed by Grateful Dead bassist Phil Lesh, with lyrics by Robert Hunter. </p>

<p>Hunter wrote the words in response to a request from Lesh to help write a song he could sing to his dying father. The song first appeared on the album <em>American Beauty</em>, released in 1970. </p>

<p>There are several unusual aspects to the band&#8217;s performance on this track. Lesh plays acoustic guitar, Dave Torbert plays bass,  David Nelson plays lead guitar on a Fender Telecaster, while Jerry Garcia plays the piano. </p>

<p>It&#8217;s a rich track musically, with intertwining voices and instruments, so it&#8217;s best to hear it in as uncompressed and high-fidelity a fashion as possible. </p>

<p>The first thing to note about this song is that, although Hunter could have responded to Lesh&#8217;s request with some very specific words about a child sitting with a dying parent, he instead generalized and broadened the song&#8217;s scope to instead speak to all of us about the meaning of life and death. </p>

<p>This is a deft example of the songwriter&#8217;s art. </p>

<p>Dylan has such an inimitable bag of tricks that many of his songs are unmistakably marked as his, either through attitude, theme, use of language, unusual length, or some combination of these factors. </p>

<p>Here, though, Dylan is like a master magician: even after you&#8217;ve taken away all the props, and had him roll up his sleeves, he can still effortlessly reach behind your ear and come back with a gold doubloon in his hand. </p>

<p>No railing against authority here, no diverse, divergent set of cultural references, no rolling series of verses, no hallucinatory imagery, no put-downs, no fancy words. </p>

<p>And yet Dylan still manages to produce a masterpiece. </p>

<p>Let&#8217;s review the lyrics. It won&#8217;t take long. </p>

<p>This has always been my favorite Lyle Lovett recording. </p>

<p>The singer starts with the chorus, which is then repeated after each verse. Both musically and lyrically, it starts out as a simple children&#8217;s song, with gentle, bright finger-picking on the guitar. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>If I had a boat,  <br />
I&#8217;d go out on the ocean.  <br />
And if I had a pony,   <br />
I&#8217;d ride him on my boat.  <br />
And we could all together  <br />
go out on the ocean,  <br />
Me upon my pony on my boat. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The chorus is clearly from the perspective of a young child. Each line is simple and short, the rhyming consisting only of the repeated use of the word &#8220;boat.&#8221; Note that Lovett&#8217;s singing is straightforward, sincere and heartfelt. </p>

<p>With the first verse, though, Lovett shifts gears, taking a slightly older, more ironic perspective. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>If I were Roy Rogers,  <br />
I&#8217;d sure enough be single.   <br />
I couldn&#8217;t bring myself to marrying old Dale.   <br />
It&#8217;d just be me and Trigger.  <br />
We&#8217;d go riding through them movies,   <br />
Then we&#8217;d buy a boat and on the sea we&#8217;d sail. </p>

<p>I have the audacity to play “Like A Rolling Stone” in my show, just about every night. I did it as a lark, to show off to some of the guys in my band that I knew all the words. But I was immediately struck by the audience response to the song. From six-year-olds to seventy-year-olds — <em>they all know the chorus to that song.</em> I couldn’t put it away; every night, it’s a unifying thing. I think it’s somehow part of the fabric of our culture. </p>

<p>“Like A Rolling Stone” is not only one of the most popular rock songs of all time, it is also one of those whose appeal is the most mysterious. Whereas it is easy to see how other Dylan songs became anthems for a generation — songs like “Blowin’ in the Wind,” “The Times They Are A-Changing” and “Mr. Tambourine Man” — it is harder to see how this song attained such a broad and enthusiastic audience. </p>

<p>Let’s start by looking at the lyrics. This song came off of Bob Dylan’s <em>John Wesley Harding</em> album, which marked a radical departure from his previous recordings. His older compositions often had many more than the standard three verses of popular songs — “Positively Fourth Street” boasted twelve. His lyrics had often been pointed and sharply critical. His use of language was unusual, and called attention to itself by juxtaposing words and images not usually associated with each other. </p>

<p>In contrast, “All Along The Watchtower” is spare and restrained. The song consists of only three verses, with no chorus. The language is simple. Yet the three verses are packed with meaning and drama. Let’s see how it starts. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>“There must be some kind of way out of here,”  <br />
Said the joker to the thief. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notice how Dylan starts the song by throwing us into the middle of a conversation, and begins with an urgent statement. </p>

</p>


<p>The beginning of the song is a study in understatement. An electric guitar plays two notes, slowly repeated, with tremolo. The drums set up a quiet pulse-like beat. An acoustic guitar enters, strumming two chords, then beginning a quiet riff that is a definition of laid-back L.A. funk. Finally Steve Stills&#8217; voice enters, in a quiet, conversational tone. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>There&#8217;s something happening here.  <br />
What it is ain&#8217;t exactly clear.  <br />
There&#8217;s a man with a gun over there,  <br />
Telling me I got to beware.  <br />
I think it&#8217;s time we stop, children, what&#8217;s that sound?  <br />
Everybody look what&#8217;s going down.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notice how the first two lines draw the listener in and create suspense. The singer says that &#8220;something is happening,&#8221; but we don&#8217;t yet have any idea what it is. The next two lines up the ante &#8211; saying that there is a &#8220;man with a gun&#8221; involved &#8211; but maintain the suspense, since we don&#8217;t know who the man is, why he has a gun, or what he intends to do with it. </p>
