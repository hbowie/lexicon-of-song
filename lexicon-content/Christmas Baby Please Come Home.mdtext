Body:

The lyrics in this song work so well because of their simple
understatement. As in the title, the single word “Christmas” is repeated
by the background choir to begin each line of the song. Darlene Love
then describes, in the briefest of sketches, familiar elements of
Christmas: “The snow’s coming down,” “Lots of people around,” “Pretty
lights on the trees,” etc. Each verse ends with the same line:
“(Christmas) Baby, Please Come Home\!”

The chorus fills in the sketchiest of details.

> They’re singing “Deck the Halls,”  
> But it’s not like Christmas at all,  
> ’Cause I remember when you were here,  
> And all the fun we had last year\!

And that’s all we’re told really. Boy and girl together last Christmas.
Boy and girl not together this Christmas. Girl misses boy. So the
apparent conflict is in their separation.

But there’s something else going on here. There is no happy ending. The
boy never shows up. If we listen closely to the lyrics and their
delivery, though, we can feel another kind of tension. There is another
conflict occurring, and that is between the forced joy of the season and
the singer’s own personal feelings of being sad and lonely. Once we
become aware of this implicit conflict, the pieces of the song fall into
place. We realize that the background choir is a group of people singing
the single word “Christmas” over and over in a monotone, the effect
being almost oppressive. In contrast, Love’s individual vocal is
marvelously expressive, her voice caressing and playing with every word,
every syllable.

In this new light, the details of the season can be seen as constant
tugs to involve the singer in the traditional, social events of the
season, to give up her feelings of loneliness and isolation, to “go with
the flow.”

With this tension in mind, let’s see how the conflict plays out and
reaches resolution.

The song opens quietly. Strings quaver in the background, foreshadowing
the emotions to come. Christmas bells ring on the beat. A lonely,
halting bass line climbs the scale and then descends repeatedly.
We work our way
through the simple chord structure for one verse. Then the drums
accelerate and launch us into the first vocal verse.

The vocal verses are richly layered. Multiple percussion instruments
play interlocking rhythms, strings play counterpoint to the vocal, what
sounds like a saxophone is used to add to the rhythmic surge. 

Darlene Love’s magnificent vocal soars in and around the pounding
rhythms, like a surfer working her way through heavy swells, just beyond
the reach of the undertow, harnessing all that power, playing with it.

A saxophone solo serves as punctuation. It is rich and warm, reminding
us of the intimacy lost, the closeness needed but no longer available.

Another chorus, then the final verse. Darlene Love’s voice quivers on
the final word of each line, as if on the verge of tears, near
breakdown. “If there was a way, I’d hold back this tear, but it’s
Christmas Day, please…”

Now the background singers echo her plea, “Please…” The call and
response continues, accelerates, trading this one word back and forth,
faster and faster, a piano now building in the background, begging for
release, gradually climbing the scale, the pounding of the drums
accelerating, until Darlene finally explodes, “Baby, please come home\!”
The piano soars now. Darlene repeats her request. The drums run free, no
longer just carrying the beat but improvising, as the power of the
climax winds down into release. Conflict between seasonal reminders
and personal feelings are resolved, as the singer expresses her emotions
fully and completely. Liberated from all restraint, she pours her true
emotions out, honestly and openly, without shame or remorse.

It’s instructive to compare this recording to another belonging to a
prior generation, but with very similar lyric and thematic content. “One
For My Baby (And One More For The Road)” was one of Frank Sinatra’s
favorite songs. This is a similar tale. Boy meets girl. Boy loses girl.
Boy misses girl. And similarly, the tension in this song is also between
the need to control and suppress one’s feelings and the need to express
them. The setting for the Sinatra song, though, is in a quiet bar late
at night. The singer is able to express his feelings only to the
bartender, and only after several drinks. He expresses his feelings with
great restraint, referring to them indirectly, saying that he has to
tell someone, or he “soon might explode.”

Given all these similarities, what is interesting is how different the
two recordings are. The resolution of the Sinatra song is in the bar
closing, the singer getting himself under control, successfully
suppressing his feelings. The resolution of the Spector song is in the
singer completely expressing and releasing her feelings. Whereas Sinatra
successfully avoids an explosion, Love successfully explodes. The lyrics
to the Sinatra song are clever and ironic. The lyrics to the Spector
song are direct and effective. Sinatra offers a wonderful interpretation
of “One For My Baby,” playing the part almost as an actor might. Love
simply uses the words and melody as a starting point, with the real
effect coming in the arrangement and vocal delivery. Instrumental
backing for the Sinatra song is spare and low-key, echoing the reserve
of the singer, and emphasizing the understated irony of the lyrics.
Instrumentation for the Spector song is rich and multi-layered,
representing the powerful opposing forces at work in the song, and the
ultimate emotional release of the singer.

All in all, this masterpiece from Spector and Love is a wonderful
example of the [new aesthetic offered by rock music](https://www.reasontorock.com/elements/overview.html).

BTW, much like Frank Capra's *It's A Wonderful Life*, the initial release of the original recording did not have any significant commercial success, but has since become something of a Christmas standard. The song was later covered by many artists, and David Letterman invited Darlene Love to perform the song on his annual Christmas show every year for 29 years, beginning in 1986.
