— George P Pelecanos, *Uncut* magazine, 2003 [][#Pelecanos:2003]  

> Never mind The Beatles or The Rolling Stones, this is the best rock’n

— Chris T-T, *Uncut* magazine, 2003 [][#T-T:2003]  

I have to add my assent to the ones above that this is one of the
greatest rock recordings of all time. If I had written the rest of [Reason To Rock](https://reasontorock.com) first, and then created a song to illustrate [everything I’d been
talking about](https://www.reasontorock.com/elements/overview.html), I couldn’t have come up with a better example.

The track opens with a jangly electric guitar. Drums and organ make a
splashy entrance on top of the guitar, and a saxophone is soon added to
the mix. They rise to a quick crescendo, prefiguring the action to come,
then drop down into the basic riff that provides backing for the verses.

Springsteen’s vocal starts. His voice is warm, relaxed, earthy and
assured, almost swaggering. He speaks his lines as much as sings them,
stretching syllables, then shortening them, playing with the beat. The
backing instruments are laid back, but energetic and playful, supporting
the mood of the singer. The sound is rich, including guitar, drums,
piano, organ and saxophone, all playing behind the vocal. The rhythms
are strong and propulsive, with the whole effect being something like a
coiled spring, suggesting hidden power yet to be unleashed. Here’s what
he sings.

> Spread out now, Rosie; Doctor, come cut loose her mama’s reins.  
> You know, playin’ blindman’s bluff is a little baby’s game.  
> You pick up Little Dynamite; I’m gonna pick up Little Gun;  
> And together we’re gonna go out tonight and make that highway run.

The overt tension of the song is laid out in these first two couplets:
Springsteen wants to release the girl from her parents so that she can
be with the singer. Rosie’s parents and their house are part of what
constrains her, but the mention of a childhood game also suggests that
Rosie herself is not sure she is ready to leave her girlhood behind and
become a young woman.

Notice the dramatic movement in the beginning of this first verse. The
first two lines describe the current state of the girl, childish and
still tied to her mother’s apron strings. The next two lines introduce
two friends whose nicknames suggest explosive and perhaps dangerous
freedom, and the intention of the singer to release the girl from her
bondage.

Note also the marvelous language that Springsteen uses. Here, as
throughout the song, he manages to choose words that work simultaneously
at two different levels. On the one hand, they sound conversational and
vernacular, as if this were a straightforward and everyday conversation
between a guy and a girl. At the same time, though, many of the words
are symbolic, and the phrasing unusual. The overall effect is of a
wonderful kind of street poetry. The names of some of their friends,
such as “Dynamite” and “Little Gun,” work in this way.

The last line quoted above is also a wonderful example of these parallel
meanings. The sentence starts out saying “we’re gonna go out tonight,”
using an altogether ordinary phrase. But then the same line finishes
with the promise, “and make that highway run.” If the word “run” is
interpreted as a noun, then this phrase is also ordinary, although there
is a hint of mystery, since we don’t know what that “highway run”
consists of, or where it leads. But the phrase could also be interpreted
to mean “force the highway to run,” a sense that has no literal meaning
but has wonderful symbolic resonance.

Another interesting element of the song is the relatively long line
length. This results in many of the lines being broken in the middle,
really containing two sentences, or a compound sentence. The effect of
this device is to convey the singer’s confidence and informality: unlike
many singers, he’s not in a hurry to neatly finish off each couplet by
supplying the closing rhyme; instead he stretches each line out,
confident we will wait around for the pay-off.

Let’s see how Springsteen closes out the verse.

> You don’t have to call me lieutenant, Rosie, and I don’t want to be
> your son.  
> The only lover I’m ever gonna need’s your soft sweet little girl’s
> tongue:  
> Rosie, you’re the one.

These three lines are wonderfully rich. It’s important to remember that,
by the time this song was released in 1973, tales of urban romance, teen
love, and liberation from parents already had a pretty full tradition.
These lines, though, make it clear that Springsteen is staking out his
own territory. The first line implies that Springsteen is not looking
for a traditional patriarchal relationship of male dominance and female
submission: he doesn’t plan on giving her orders or on calling her his
mama. The next line is wonderfully sensual, going beyond the bounds of
traditional propriety in pop and rock songs. And the last line, in its
elegant simplicity, says that he is not merely interested in playing
around with her or in another sexual exploit. So while the overt
conflict in the song is in freeing Rosie from her parents, there are
other sorts of liberation at work here too.

Underneath the lyrics, the music is doing interesting things as well.
The urgency of the rhythms build beneath the first line above. The song
then slows for thoughtful reflection behind the second line, emphasizing
the intimacy of the words. The drums and sax then soar again when we hit
the climactic exclamation, “Rosie, you’re the one,” carrying us along
into the second verse.

> Dynamite’s in the belfry, playin’ with the bats.  
> Little Gun’s downtown in front of Woolworth’s,  
> tryin’ out his attitude on all the cats.  
> Papa’s on the corner, waitin’ for the bus.  
> Mama, she’s home in the window, waitin’ up for us.  
> She’ll be there in that chair when they wrestle her upstairs,  
> ’cause you know we ain’t gonna come.  
> I ain’t here for business, I’m only here for fun:  
> And Rosie, you’re the one.

The second verse continues in the vein established by the first, with
some interesting variations. Some humor is added to the mix, giving us a
break from the urgency of the first verse. The playful use of language
continues, including the wonderful declaration, “I ain’t here for
business, I’m only here for fun.” Line lengths now vary quite a bit,
again giving the singer a chance to play with rhythm and melody, this
time by stretching out one line and then racing through the next. Some
internal rhymes begin to show up, such as “chair” and “upstairs,” adding
to the playfulness of the song. Clarence Clemons’ sax soars gracefully
behind the singer, suggesting the release from parental controls into
the fluid freedoms of youthful camaraderie.

Now, for the first time, we hit the wonderful chorus. Springsteen is
helped out on vocals by his band members singing backup, embodying the
youthful community he has been describing. Clemons continues to soar on
sax, adding a suggestion of salsa as we find out Rosie’s full name and
discover her Hispanic heritage. 

> Rosalita, jump a little lighter.  
> Se&ntilde;orita, come sit by my fire.  
> I just want to be your lover, ain’t no liar.  
> Rosalita you’re my stone desire.

The best part of the chorus is the first line. Springsteen again makes
it clear he is not attempting to liberate Rosie from one constraining
relationship only to bind her to another one. Has there ever been a more
graceful, liberating injunction between prospective lovers? “Rosalita,
jump a little lighter\!” The saxophone continues beyond the words,
lightly climbing the scales, embodying the release suggested by the
lyrics.

The third verse, again followed by the chorus, names additional
characters, adding to the feeling of community that illuminates the
song. Springsteen also strengthens his injunction to Rosie to join him,
urging her to walk right out through the front door, adding to the sense
that he wants her psychological liberation as much as her physical
escape.

> Jack the Rabbit and Weak Knees Willie, you know they’re gonna be
> there.  
> Ah, sloppy Sue and Big Bones Billie, they’ll be comin’ up for air.  
> We’re gonna play some pool, skip some school, act real cool,  
> stay out all night, it’s gonna feel all right,  
> So Rosie come out tonight. Baby, come out tonight.
> 
> Windows are for cheaters; chimneys for the poor;  
> Closets are for hangers; winners use the door:  
> So use it Rosie, that’s what it’s there for.
> 
> Rosalita, jump a little lighter.  
> Se&ntilde;orita, come sit by my fire.  
> I just want to be your lover, ain’t no liar.  
> Rosalita you’re my stone desire.

Springsteen now plays with the structure of the song. We hear a sort of
false ending, an extended musical interlude that could easily have faded
out, with the song already at about the four minute mark. But instead
the music slows, pauses, then resumes slowly behind the singer as he
speaks the following confessional.

> Now, I know, your mama, she don’t like me,   
> ’cause I play in a rock and roll band.   
> And I know your daddy, he don’t dig me,   
> but he never did understand.   
> Papa lowered the boom, he locked you in your room —
> 
> I’m comin’ to lend a hand…  
> I’m comin’ to liberate you, confiscate you — I want to be your man.  
> Someday we’ll look back on this, and it will all seem funny.

Now the song begins to rev up again, the band playing louder,
Springsteen’s voice rising in intensity.

> But now you’re sad, your mama’s mad,  
> And your papa says he knows that I don’t have any money;  
> Oh, your papa says he knows that I don’t have any money;  
> Oh so your daddy says he knows that I don’t have any money —

These last three lines are sung with the band acting as chorus, with
only drums for backup, and with hand claps emphasizing the rhythm. The
group almost sounds like a chain gang, singing the same lines over and
over again to provide rhythm for their physical labors. The effect is
certainly to suggest poverty and a lack of freedom. But now the music
explodes and the lyrics provide a sudden dramatic reversal.

> Tell him this is his last chance…  
> To get his daughter in a fine romance…  
> Because a record company, Rosie, just gave me a big advance\!

Here, for one shining moment, the singer seems to have it all: the
usually adult attributes of money, power and respect, while still
retaining his youth, his community of peers, his playful attitude, and
his love. But the beginning of the next verse starts immediately,
comically deflating the image before it can become overstated.

> My tires were slashed, and I almost crashed, but the Lord had mercy.  
> My machine she’s a dud, I’m stuck in the mud,  
> somewhere in the swamps of Jersey.  
> Hold on tight, stay up all night, ‘cause Rosie I’m comin’ on strong.  
> By the time we meet, in the morning light, I will hold you in my arms.

Now, at the end of this verse, we get a glimpse of real freedom, of the
promised land. The music slows, and the singer’s reading is
breathtakingly beautiful. 

> I know a pretty little place, in Southern California, down San Diego
> way:  
> There’s a little caf&eacute;, where they play guitars all night and
> day,  
> You can hear them in the back room strummin’.  
> So hold tight baby, ‘cause don’t you know daddy’s comin’.
> 
> Everybody sing:
> 
> Rosalita, jump a little lighter.  
> Se&ntilde;orita, come sit by my fire.  
> I just want to be your lover, ain’t no liar.  
> Rosalita you’re my stone desire.

We hit the chorus again and then the song comes to a big muscular
finish, the band playing for all it’s worth, shouting in the background,
finally winding down into a single echoing note on the organ.

This song has it all. The lyrics are funny, personal and idiosyncratic,
bringing you into touch with real people and real situations. The song
describes liberation from parents, from traditional social structures,
from the boring world of adult toil, and into authentic love, community,
adventure and art. The structure of the song is fluid and full of
surprises, liberating itself from traditional forms as it goes. The
playing of the band is strong and supple. The instruments are as
restless as the singer, yet moving in perfect sympathy and synchronicity
with him. Together they perform as one cohesive unit, yet with room for
all the individual parts, and allowing them all full freedom of
expression.

This is rock music at its best.
