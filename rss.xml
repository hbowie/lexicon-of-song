			&lt;p&gt;My earliest memory of this song is hearing it on the first album by The Band, &lt;em&gt;Music from Big Pink&lt;/em&gt;, back in 1968. I understood then that this was the one song on the album that was written neither by members of The Band nor by Bob Dylan, but didn&amp;#8217;t know much else about it at the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, a few years later, I discovered that it was one of the few songs that my father and I both knew, and could play together on our guitars. Turned out he had probably heard it as recorded by The Country Gentlemen on their 1960 album, &lt;em&gt;Country Songs Old &amp;amp; New&lt;/em&gt;, or had simply heard this same group perform the song at one of their many shows at the Crossroads, outside of DC, a venue my dad was known to have frequented. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then, I found the song included on the Rosanne Cash album &lt;em&gt;The List&lt;/em&gt;, the title referring to a list of essential American songs as identified by &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt; father, Johnny Cash. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then, later, it just started to turn up everywhere. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A couple of things that happened recently got me cogitating on the idea of language as playground. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I had a chance to hear &lt;a href=&quot;https://acurzan.english.lsa.umich.edu&quot;&gt;Anne Curzan&lt;/a&gt; speak. Curzan is the talented and engaging dean of the College of Literature, Science and the Arts at the University of Michigan (my alma mater), and is also a linguist who studies the history of the English language. Her bio states that she &amp;#8220;aims to promote a culture based in purpose and contributing to the common good, the power of learning, &lt;em&gt;the value of play&lt;/em&gt; [emphasis mine], and the importance of well-being.&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I&amp;#8217;m here to tell you: any time you stir together the value of play and the study of the English language in the same pitcher, you&amp;#8217;re mixing up a cocktail that I will happily imbibe. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;As children, our thoughts about death are stuff of dreams and fairy tales. As adults we learn to suppress these thoughts because we are busy getting on with things. But as teenagers, in this transition between nursery rhymes and real life, we tend to approach this topic with a frankness and curiosity that can be somewhat startling. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laura Nyro wrote her song &amp;#8220;&lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;And When I Die&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; at the age of 17, and her refreshing treatment of the subject shows none of the reverence or piety that we learn to adopt as adults. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s look over her lyrics. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when I die and when I&amp;#8217;m dead, dead and gone,   &lt;br /&gt;
There&amp;#8217;ll be one child born and a world to carry on, to carry on.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not scared of dying and I don&amp;#8217;t really care.   &lt;br /&gt;
If it&amp;#8217;s peace you find in dying, well, then let the time be near.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The history of Leonard Cohen&amp;#8217;s song &amp;#8220;Hallelujah&amp;#8221; is a fascinating one. Cohen&amp;#8217;s songs had never really been embraced by the masses, and his first recording of &amp;#8220;Hallelujah&amp;#8221; in the early eighties was part of an album so lacking in obvious commercial appeal that the president of CBS Records responded to it by saying: &amp;#8220;What is this? This isn&amp;#8217;t pop music. We&amp;#8217;re not releasing it. This is a disaster.&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That recording was released, however, a little later on a small independent label, but few people took note of the album or of this particular song. Even for Cohen&amp;#8217;s small set of fans, it did not seem like a particularly memorable recording. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then a funny series of events began to play out over the next couple of decades. John Cale, formerly of the &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;Velvet Underground&lt;/a&gt;, and himself not a household name, recorded a version of the song for a Cohen tribute album in 1991. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d been aware of &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;Paul Thorn&lt;/a&gt; for some time, but didn&amp;#8217;t really become a fan until I saw him live last summer at &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;The Ark&lt;/a&gt; in Ann Arbor. I convinced an old University of Michigan roommate to come with me while I was in town, as an opportunity to catch up, but we were both caught off guard by how much we loved Thorn&amp;#8217;s show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been listening to Thorn&amp;#8217;s recordings regularly since then, and can now bear witness to &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;a great catalog&lt;/a&gt; that stands up to deep and repeated listening.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Musically Thorn reminds me of &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;Delbert McClinton&lt;/a&gt; and a few other artists who have somewhat belatedly been collected under the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;Americana&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; banner. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;From the Dictionary app on my iMac: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;fruitcake: 1. A cake containing dried fruit and nuts.2. (informal) an eccentric or insane person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve always considered &amp;#8220;&lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;Fruitcakes&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; to be Jimmy Buffet&amp;#8217;s masterwork. The musical backing is infectious, swaying and danceable, and the background vocals add depth. The words are cleverly crafted, and perfectly suited to Buffett&amp;#8217;s conversational, wisecracking delivery. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The song is from 1993, and contains some dated references, but these just add to the fun for me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The singer starts with a spoken introduction, setting up the verses that will follow. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know I was talking to my friend Desdemona the other day. She runs this space station bake shop down near Boomtown. She told me that human beings are flawed individuals, that the cosmic bakers took us out of the oven a little too early, and that&amp;#8217;s the reason we&amp;#8217;re as crazy as we are, and I believe it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note what Buffett is doing here. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;This is a rather amazing song by The Kinks, first released in 1968. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved this song from the moment I first heard it, but my appreciation for it has only grown over the years. &lt;/p&gt;

		<title>An Appreciation for the song &quot;For What It&apos;s Worth&quot;</title>

			&lt;p&gt;The beginning of the song is a study in understatement. An electric guitar plays two notes, slowly repeated, with tremolo. The drums set up a quiet pulse-like beat. An acoustic guitar enters, strumming two chords, then beginning a quiet riff that is a definition of laid-back L.A. funk. Finally Steve Stills&amp;#8217; voice enters, in a quiet, conversational tone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s something happening here.  &lt;br /&gt;
What it is ain&amp;#8217;t exactly clear.  &lt;br /&gt;
There&amp;#8217;s a man with a gun over there,  &lt;br /&gt;
Telling me I got to beware.  &lt;br /&gt;
I think it&amp;#8217;s time we stop, children, what&amp;#8217;s that sound?  &lt;br /&gt;
Everybody look what&amp;#8217;s going down.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice how the first two lines draw the listener in and create suspense. The singer says that &amp;#8220;something is happening,&amp;#8221; but we don&amp;#8217;t yet have any idea what it is. The next two lines up the ante &amp;#8211; saying that there is a &amp;#8220;man with a gun&amp;#8221; involved &amp;#8211; but maintain the suspense, since we don&amp;#8217;t know who the man is, why he has a gun, or what he intends to do with it. &lt;/p&gt;
